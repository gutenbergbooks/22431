<h2>DAVE DARRIN
<br />ON MEDITERRANEAN SERVICE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>GREEN HAT, THE TROUBLE-STARTER</h3>


<p>"Dan," whispered Dave Darrin, Ensign,
United States Navy, to his chum and
brother officer, "do you see that fellow
with the green Alpine hat and the green vest?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Dan Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Watch him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He's a powerful brute, and it looks as though
he's spoiling for a fight."</p>

<p>"You are not going to oblige him, are you?"
asked Dalzell in a whisper, betraying surprise.</p>

<p>"Nothing like it," Darrin responded disgustedly.
"Danny Grin, don't you credit me with more
sense than that? Do you imagine I'd engage in
a fight in a place like this?"</p>

<p>"Then why are you interested in what the
fellow might do?" demanded Ensign Dan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I think there is going to be a lively
time here. That fellow under the Alpine hat is
equal to at least four of these spindling Spanish
waiters. There is going to be trouble within four
minutes, or I'm a poor guesser."</p>

<p>"Just let Mr. Green Hat start something,"
chuckled Ensign Dalzell in an undertone. "There
are plenty of stalwart British soldiers here, and
'Tommy Atkins' never has been known to be
averse to a good fair fight. The soldiers will
wipe up the floor with him. Then there is the
provost guard, patrolling the streets of Gibraltar.
If Mr. Green Hat grows too noisy the provost
guard will gather him in."</p>

<p>"And might also gather us in, if the provost
officer thought us intelligent witnesses," muttered
Darrin.</p>

<p>"That would be all right, too," grinned Dan.
"There is bound to be a British army officer in
command of the provost guard. As soon as we
handed him cards showing us to be American
naval officers he'd raise his cap to us, and that
would be the end of it."</p>

<p>"I don't like to be present at rows in a place
of this kind," Ensign Darrin insisted.</p>

<p>"Then we'd better be going," proposed Ensign
Dalzell.</p>

<p>The place was Gibraltar, and the time nine
o'clock in the evening. The two friends were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seated well back in one of the several Spanish
vaudeville theatres that flourish more or less in
the city on the Great Rock, even in such times
as this period of the great European War.</p>

<p>The theatre was not a low place, or it would
not have been permitted to exist in Gibraltar,
which, even in peace times, is under the strictest
military rule, made much more strict at the
beginning of the great war. The performance
was an ordinary one and rather dull. At the
moment three Spanish women occupied the
stage, going rather hopelessly through the steps
of an aimless dance, while three musicians ground
out the music for the dancers. The next number,
as announced on a card that hung at one side of
the stage, was to be a pantomime.</p>

<p>One particularly unpleasant feature only was
to be noted in the place. Wines and liquors
were served to those who chose to order them,
Spanish waiters passing up and down the aisles
in search of custom.</p>

<p>Mr. Green Hat, to the knowledge of Ensigns
Darrin and Dalzell, had been a much too frequent
customer. He was now arguing with two waiters
about an alleged mistake in the changing of the
money he had handed one of them. From angry
remonstrance Mr. Green Hat was now resorting
to abusive language.</p>

<p>"I'd like to implant a wallop under that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
rowdy's chin," muttered Dan Dalzell, as he
started to rise.</p>

<p>"Don't try it," warned Ensign Dave, as he,
too, rose.</p>

<p>Just then the lightning struck; the storm broke.</p>

<p>With an angry bellow, Mr. Green Hat leaped
to his feet, knocking down one of the waiters.
Four others rushed to the spot. The five promptly
assailed Mr. Green Hat, and were swiftly reinforced
by the one who had been floored.</p>

<p>But the stalwart, active brawler proved to be
too much for the combined force of the waiters.
As if they had been so many reeds, Mr. Green
Hat brushed them aside with his fists.</p>

<p>"Grab the bloomin' rotter and throw 'im h'out!"
bellowed a "Tommy Atkins," as the British
soldier is collectively known.</p>

<p>A new note, in a decidedly American tone of
protest, rose above the uproar.</p>

<p>"How dare you? What do you mean, fellow?"
demanded a young man in a gray traveling suit,
glaring up from the floor, to which he, an unoffending
occupant of an aisle seat, had suddenly
been hurled.</p>

<p>It was too much for Dan Dalzell, who promptly
attempted to seize Mr. Green Hat as that individual,
with the momentum of a steam roller,
rushed up the aisle.</p>

<p>Dalzell reached out a hand to grip Mr. Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Hat by the collar. All too promptly a heavy fist
smote Dan in the chest, knocking him back into
the arms of Dave Darrin. Dave himself could
not act quickly enough to avenge the blow that
had been dealt his chum, because Dan's body
blocked the way.</p>

<p>Four or five British soldiers at the rear of the
little theatre tried to intercept Mr. Green Hat
as he dashed up the aisle. Three of the "Messrs.
Atkins" went to the floor, under the seats, while
the others were brushed aside, and Mr. Green
Hat reached the street.</p>

<p>"Stop that thief!" roared the young man in
the gray suit. "He has robbed me!"</p>

<p>By this time Dalzell was again on his feet and
out in the aisle. He sprinted for the street, followed
closely by Dave Darrin. The young man
in the gray suit, his face pallid, plunged after the
young naval officers.</p>

<p>"You're an American, aren't you?" called
Dave, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered he of the gray suit, "and in
official life at Washington, too. That scoundrel
has robbed me of something of value to the
United States government."</p>

<p>That was enough for Darrin and Dalzell.
Though the charge might prove to be false, it
was enough to cancel Dave's scruples against
fighting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Out into the street ahead of them ran a waiter,
who had taken no part in the scrimmage, waving
his arms and shouting:</p>

<p>"<i>Esta direcci&oacute;n!</i>" ("This way!")</p>

<p>"<i>Sigue andando!</i>" ("Keep right on!") roared
Danny Grin, darting down the street at a hard
pace.</p>

<p>But a moment later both naval officers, followed
by the young man in gray and the waiter,
came to a halt, for, directly ahead of them, on
the well-lighted street, suddenly appeared a
patrol detachment of the British provost guard.</p>

<p>"Did you stop the fellow who ran this way,
sir?" hailed Ensign Darrin, as he recognized the
uniform of the British infantry officer in command
of the detachment.</p>

<p>"We didn't see any man running this way,"
replied the British lieutenant, smartly returning
the salute that Ensign Darrin had given him.</p>

<p>"Didn't <i>see</i> any fellow running?" repeated
three Americans, in tones of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"We were chasing a thief, sir," Darrin continued,
"and this waiter told us that the fugitive
ran this way."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought he did," stammered the waiter
in Spanish, though it was now plain that he
understood English.</p>

<p>In deep disgust and with dawning suspicion,
Dave Darrin glared at the waiter until that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
fellow changed color and trembled slightly. Dave
was now certain that the waiter, probably by
previous arrangement, had shielded the escape of
Mr. Green Hat.</p>

<p>Turning to the English officer, Dave quickly
recounted what had happened. At the same
time he introduced himself and Dan as American
naval officers, and both tendered their cards.</p>

<p>"And you, sir? Who are you, and what did
you lose?" inquired the British officer, turning
to the young man in the gray suit.</p>

<p>"May I answer that question to an officer of
my own country?" appealed the young man in
the gray suit.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the British officer, after keenly
regarding the stranger who claimed to have been
robbed.</p>

<p>"Will you step a few yards down the street
with me?" urged the unknown American, addressing
Dave.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Darrin nodded, for he saw insistent
appeal in the stranger's gaze.</p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin," began the stranger, using the
name he had heard Dave announce in the introductions
to the Britisher, "do you really belong
to the American Navy?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," Darrin answered. "I am attached
to the battleship 'Hudson,' now lying in
this harbor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I will introduce myself," continued the
young man in the gray suit. "My name is
George Cushing. Do you recognize the meaning
of this?"</p>

<p>"This" proved to be a small gold badge, revealed
by Cushing as he turned back the lapel
of his coat. It was a badge worn by men belonging
to a special branch of the secret service of the
American Department of State. The members of
this special service are usually found, if found at
all, on duty in foreign countries.</p>

<p>"I know the badge, Mr. Cushing," nodded
Dave Darrin. "Now, what have you to tell
me?"</p>

<p>"That big man with the green hat must have
started that fight with the waiters in the theatre
to cover his intended attack on me," Cushing
replied. "At the moment of knocking me down,
he snatched from my coat pocket and made off
with a most important document."</p>

<p>"Then you almost deserved to lose it, sir,"
replied Darrin sternly, "as a punishment for
wasting your time in such a place as that theatre."</p>

<p>"I must see the American admiral as soon as
possible," urged Cushing, ignoring Darrin's reproof.
"But first of all, I must ask you to pass
me safely by that provost guard, or I might be
detained at a time when I cannot afford to lose
a single instant. You will vouch for me, won't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you, Mr. Darrin? Here are my formal credentials,"
continued Cushing, producing and unfolding
a wallet that contained properly sealed
and signed credentials from the American Department
of State.</p>

<p>"The paper that was stolen from you did not
in any way relate to the defenses and fortifications
here at Gibraltar, did it?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Cushing replied promptly.</p>

<p>"You give me your word of honor for that?"
Dave asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Do you believe I'd waste my time on such
rubbish as that?" demanded Cushing, scornfully.
"Why, every civilized government on
earth possesses accurate plans of the fortifications
at Gibraltar! I give you my word of honor,
Mr. Darrin, that the paper stolen from me did
not in any way relate to the Gibraltar fortifications."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do my best to get you by the provost
guard," Ensign Darrin promised, turning to lead
the way back.</p>

<p>"Sir," Dave announced to Lieutenant Abercrombie,
commanding the provost guard detachment,
"I beg to report, on what I regard as the
best of authority, that there is no reason why my
countryman, Mr. Cushing, should be detained
by you."</p>

<p>"Then that of which he claims to have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
robbed is nothing that could officially interest
me?" pressed the British officer.</p>

<p>"I am certain that the matter could not interest
a British officer, except in his desire to see a
thief caught," Ensign Darrin vouched.</p>

<p>"That is all, then," replied Lieutenant Abercrombie.
"Gentlemen, you are at liberty to
proceed on your way."</p>

<p>In the meantime the Spanish waiter had slipped
back to the theatre.</p>

<p>Dave and Dan saluted, the Englishman doing
the same. Then Lieutenant Abercrombie gave
each of these brothers in arms a hearty handclasp.
The men of the provost guard parted to
allow the three Americans to pass on their way.</p>

<p>"And now where do you wish to go, Mr.
Cushing?" Dave inquired, after they had passed
the British provost guard.</p>

<p>"I suppose you expect me to search for the
thief," rejoined the man from the State Department.
"But that would now be worse than a
waste of time. Gibraltar, quaint Moorish city
that it is, is so full of holes in the wall that it
would be impossible to find the thief, for he will
not venture out again to-night. The best thing
I can do will be to go straight to the American
admiral, and you gentlemen, I imagine, can take
me there."</p>

<p>"A launch will put off from the mole for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
flagship at ten o'clock," Dave informed him.
"We may as well go down to the mole and wait."</p>

<p>Twice, on the way, after leaving the more
crowded parts of the city behind, the three were
challenged by English sentries invisible in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Who goes there?" came the sentry's hail in
each instance.</p>

<p>"Officers from the American flagship," Darrin
answered for the party.</p>

<p>"Pass on, gentlemen," came the response out
of the darkness.</p>

<p>At all times strict watch over all comers outside
the British army service is kept at Gibraltar,
and after dark this vigilance is doubled.</p>

<p>"On a moonless night like this, one would
imagine that Gibraltar, save for the few blocks
of 'city,' held few human beings," murmured
Dan, as the three continued on at a quiet walk
toward the water front. "One gets the impression
that there are but a few sentries, sprinkled
here and there, yet we know there are thousands
of British soldiers scattered over this rock."</p>

<p>"Hardly scattered," smiled Dave Darrin. "Except
for the guard, men and officers are alike in
barracks, and many of the barracks are at rather
long distances from the fortifications."</p>

<p>Nor are the fortifications to be found along
the water front. Back on the great hill of rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
are gun embrasures, often cut into the face
of the rock itself. Back of the embrasures are
galleries cut through the stone, and here, in time
of siege, the soldiers would stand behind the
huge guns.</p>

<p>Gibraltar's harbor is small, though large enough
to hold a great fleet. In the days when cannon
had shorter range than now, a British fleet might
have hidden in the harbor and been secure against
all the fleets of the world, for the guns of the
huge fortress could have sunk the combined
navies of the world, had they attempted to enter
the harbor. In these modern days Gibraltar is
not so secure, for the heights of Algeciras, in
Spain, are only about seven miles away. If
Spain were at war with Great Britain, or if any
other power took the heights of Algeciras from
Spain, guns could be mounted on those heights
that would dominate the harbor of Gibraltar.
None the less, as long as war exists and the huge
stone height of Gibraltar remains, the impression
of strong military force will abide with the
rock.</p>

<p>Down at the mole a British sentry stopped the
trio. Near him stood a corporal and three other
soldiers.</p>

<p>"American officers and a friend," replied Ensign
Darrin, when halted by this sentry. Then the
trio advanced when ordered. Lieutenant Totten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the 'Hudson,' stepped forward, peered at
Darrin and Dalzell, and said to the corporal:</p>

<p>"I recognize these gentlemen as officers of
ours."</p>

<p>"And the friend?" inquired the corporal.</p>

<p>"The friend is an American citizen who has
business with Admiral Timworth," Dave stated.</p>

<p>"Then it is all right," Lieutenant Totten assured
the corporal.</p>

<p>Whereupon the British corporal permitted
Cushing to step out on the mole with his companions,
Darrin and Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Which is the flagship launch?" asked Darrin.</p>

<p>"The rearmost," answered Lieutenant Totten.
"Ours is the only launch here. The two other
launches belong to the warships of other powers."</p>

<p>Cushing, while this brief conversation was
going on, had walked rapidly along the mole
until he reached the farthest launch.</p>

<p>"I want you!" he shouted, bending over suddenly.</p>

<p>He had found and seized by the coat collar the
man with the green hat.</p>

<p>Dave and Dan rushed to the spot, hardly
knowing what they could do, as they did not
want to see the representative of the American
State Department lack for backing.</p>

<p>"Pull Cushing away from that fellow," ordered
Totten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that an official order?" Dave flashed back,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>"It is," nodded Totten, and faded back into
the blackness of the night.</p>

<p>Dave bounded forward. He saw that the
launch was one belonging to some liner or merchant
ship in the harbor. Three or four men belonging
in that launch had leaped to the rescue of Mr.
Green Hat. Dave, with one tug, tore Cushing
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Green Hat fell back in the launch. Two
sailors belonging to that craft cast off the lines
at bow and stern, and the launch glided out into
the harbor.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you help me, instead of putting
the double cross on me?" Cushing demanded,
angrily.</p>

<p>"I had my reasons," Ensign Darrin replied,
briefly.</p>

<p>"They must have been good ones," muttered
Cushing.</p>

<p>"All aboard for the flagship!" announced
Lieutenant Totten, in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"Come along, if you're going out with us,"
Darrin urged Cushing.</p>

<p>The passengers for the flagship launch were
speedily aboard. Other officers were there who
had been ashore for the evening.</p>

<p>As the launch was cast off she glided almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
noiselessly across the smooth water of the harbor,
followed closely by the shifting rays of a British
searchlight on shore. Ever since the great
European war had started searchlights stationed
on shore had followed the movements of every
craft in the harbor at night. Beyond, the flagship's
few lights glowed brightly. In a few
minutes the party was alongside.</p>

<p>Dave and Dan, after saluting the officer of the
deck, and reporting their presence on board,
went at once to Dave's quarters.</p>

<p>"There was a good deal of a mix-up, somewhere,"
Dan announced, at once. "Why should
Totten order you to drag Cushing away from
Mr. Green Hat, when that rascal had robbed
Cushing of valuable government papers?"</p>

<p>"It's too big a puzzle for me," Ensign Darrin
admitted, promptly. "But Lieutenant Totten
is my superior officer, and the responsibility belongs
to him."</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two chums chatted.
Dalzell was about to say good night and go to
his own quarters, when an orderly rapped at the
door, then entered, saluting.</p>

<p>"The admiral's compliments, gentlemen," said
the messenger. "The admiral wishes to see
Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell at once."</p>

<p>"Our compliments, and we will report at once,"
Dave answered. Both young officers were now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in uniform, for Dan had left his in Dave's quarters
before going ashore, and the chums had changed
their clothes while chatting. It now remained
only for Dave to reach for his sword and fasten
it on, then draw on white gloves, while Dalzell
went to his quarters, next door, and did the
same.</p>

<p>"What can be in the wind?" whispered Dan.
"This is the first time that Admiral Timworth
has ever expressed any desire to see us. Can it
be that we bungled in some way with the Cushing
business?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to waste any time in guessing,"
replied Ensign Darrin, as they stepped briskly
along, "when I'm going to have the answer
presented to me so soon."</p>

<p>Then they halted before the entrance to the
admiral's quarters, to learn if it would be agreeable
for the admiral to receive them at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>DAN'S THIRTY-THREE-DOLLAR GUESS</h3>


<p>As the two young officers entered the admiral's
quarters the curtains were closed
behind them by the marine orderly.</p>

<p>Admiral Timworth was seated at his desk.
Beside him was Captain Allen, commanding officer
of the battleship "Hudson," flagship of the
Mediterranean Squadron.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Totten and Cushing were also
present.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," was Admiral Timworth's
greeting, after salutes had been exchanged.
"Accidentally, you became spectators this evening,
at a little drama connected with both the
diplomatic and the secret service of your country."</p>

<p>The admiral paused, but both young officers
remained respectfully at attention, making no
response, as none was needed.</p>

<p>"You are aware," continued the admiral,
"that Mr. Cushing was knocked down and robbed
of an important government paper. Now, it
happens that this paper was the key to a code
employed by the State and Navy Departments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in communicating with naval commanders
abroad."</p>

<p>This time Dave actually started. The loss of
such a code would be vitally important. The
State and Navy Departments almost invariably
communicate with naval commanders by means
of a secret code, which can be read only by commanders
possessing the key. Thus, when cablegrams
are sent from stations in foreign countries,
their import can be understood only by the
officers to whom the communications are addressed.</p>

<p>"That strikes you as a most serious loss, does
it not?" asked Admiral Timworth, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir; so it would seem," Dave answered,
bowing.</p>

<p>"The code that was stolen to-night," laughed
the admiral, "will be of but little value to the
government into whose hands it may fall. The
code in question was one that was used in the
year 1880, and has not been employed since.
Nor is it likely ever to be employed again."</p>

<p>Captain Allen joined in the admiral's laugh.</p>

<p>"We had every reason," continued the admiral,
"to believe that an attempt would be made
to steal that code ere Mr. Cushing delivered it
to me. In fact, our government allowed it to be
rather widely known that Mr. Cushing had
left Washington to turn over to me a code. So,
of course, Mr. Cushing has been followed. As a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
matter of fact, the code that we have been using
for the last six months has not been changed.
I was delighted when I learned that Cushing
had been assaulted and robbed. Mr. Cushing
himself took the loss seriously, for he did not know,
until he came aboard a few moments ago, that
the United States government had hoped he
<i>would</i> be robbed. Lieutenant Totten was sent
ashore, ostensibly to look after the launch, but
in reality, to learn, if possible, whether Cushing's
assailant put off in the launch of another power,
and if so, which power. Ensigns Darrin and
Dalzell, you noted, did you not, the nationality
of the launch in which Mr. Cushing's assailant
escaped?"</p>

<p>"I did not, sir," Dave replied. "It was not
a naval launch, and therefore did not belong to
any ships belonging to the Entente Allies' naval
vessels in port here."</p>

<p>"Then, gentlemen," continued Admiral Timworth,
his voice in tones of formal command,
"you will not at any time mention this matter
to any one unless so directed by me. I have
had just one object in sending for you and giving
you this order. For some time our Government
has known that secret efforts are being made
to discredit us with the allied powers of Europe.
I feel rather certain that this fleet, while in the
Mediterranean, will be closely watched by plotters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
serving one of the Central European powers, or
else acting on their own account in the hope of
being able to succeed and then claim reward
from that government. Keep your eyes open.
You may meet other spies and have reason to
suspect them to be such. Do not be fooled by
the apparent nationality of any man's name.
A spy uses many names in his course around the
world. Few international spies ever use their
own names. The man in the green hat, who
assaulted Mr. Cushing to-night, is one of the
cleverest of his kind, and perhaps the most able
with whom we shall have to contend. The
fellow's name is supposed to be Emil Gortchky.
At one time or another he has served as spy for
nearly every government in Europe. He is a
daring, dangerous, and wholly unscrupulous fellow.
Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell, I sent for you
in order to tell you these things, and to add that
if, during this cruise, you run across the fellow
at any point, you are to report the fact to me
promptly. Of course you will understand that the
seal of official secrecy attaches to all that I have
said. That is all, gentlemen. Good evening."</p>

<p>Saluting, Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell promptly
withdrew. They were still a good deal puzzled.</p>

<p>"I'll come to your quarters in a minute, if
I may," murmured Danny Grin, as he reached
the door of his own cabin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want you to come," Dave answered dryly.</p>

<p>So, in another minute, Dan Dalzell, minus
sword and gloves, bobbed into Dave's room.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you make out of all we have
heard and seen?" breathed Dalzell tensely.</p>

<p>"Just what the admiral told us," answered
Darrin.</p>

<p>"Nothing more?" pressed Dan.</p>

<p>Dave was thoughtful for a few moments before
he replied:</p>

<p>"Danny, boy, we have our orders from the
commander of the fleet. If we encounter Mr.
Green Hat anywhere in the future, we are to
report the fact. That is the extent of our instructions,
and I think we shall do very well not to
think too much about the matter, but to be
ready, at all times, to follow our orders."</p>

<p>"I was in hope that you could evolve something
more romantic than that," returned Dalzell
disappointedly.</p>

<p>"It is very likely," went on Dave judicially,
"that we have already had as large a hand in
the affair as we are going to have. I doubt if
we shall hear anything more of Mr. Green Hat;
even if we hear of his further deeds, we are not
likely to have any personal part in them."</p>

<p>"I'm disappointed," Dan admitted, rising.
"I'm going to bed now, for I have to be up at
half-past three, to turn out on watch at eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
bells. You, lucky dog, have no watch to stand
until after breakfast. Good night, Dave!"</p>

<p>"Good night; and don't dream of Mr. Green
Hat," smiled Darrin. "You'll never see him
again."</p>

<p>In that prediction Ensign Darrin was destined
to find himself fearfully wide of the mark. Mr.
Green Hat was not to be so easily dropped from
the future calculations of the youngest naval
officers on the "Hudson."</p>

<p>None of our readers require any introduction
to Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell, ofttimes known
as "Danny Grin." These two fast friends in the
naval service were members of "Dick &amp; Co.,"
a famous sextette of schoolboys in Gridley.
Dick Prescott, Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan
Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton first
appeared in the pages of "<span class="smcap">The Grammar School
Boys Series</span>," in which volumes were described
the early lives of these young American schoolboys.</p>

<p>We found the six boys again in the pages of
the "<span class="smcap">High School Boys Series</span>," in the volumes
of which the athletic triumphs of Dick &amp; Co.
were vividly set forth. In the "<span class="smcap">High School
Boys' Vacation Series</span>" were recounted their
further adventures.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of their high school careers
the six chums separated to seek different fields
of endeavor. Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
secured appointments as cadets at the United
States Military Academy at West Point, as
narrated in the "<span class="smcap">West Point Series</span>." Dave
Darrin and Dan Dalzell were nominated as
midshipmen to the United States Naval Academy
at Annapolis, and all that befell them there is
set forth in the "<span class="smcap">Annapolis Series</span>." The great
things that happened to Tom Reade and Harry
Hazelton are told in the volumes of the "<span class="smcap">Young
Engineers Series</span>." Dick Prescott's and Greg
Holmes' adventures in the Army, after graduation
from West Point, are set forth in the volumes
of the "<span class="smcap">Boys of the Army Series</span>."</p>

<p>The "<span class="smcap">Dave Darrin Series</span>" is devoted to
the lives of Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell as
naval officers, after their graduation from the
Naval Academy. We now find them serving
as ensigns, this being the lowest rank among
commissioned officers of the United States Navy.</p>

<p>The first volume of this series, published under
the title, "<span class="smcap">Dave Darrin at Vera Cruz</span>," tells
the story of Dave's and Dan's initial active
service in the United States Navy. That our
two young ensigns took an exciting part in the
fighting there is known to all our readers.</p>

<p>For some time after the taking of Vera Cruz
by the United States forces and the arrival of
Regular Army regiments, Dave and Dan continued
to serve with constant credit aboard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
"Long Island," stationed at Vera Cruz. Then
followed their detachment from the "Long Island,"
and their return to the United States. They
were then ordered to duty with the Mediterranean
Squadron, aboard the flagship "Hudson."
We already know what befell them on
their arrival at their first port of call, the British
fortress of Gibraltar, and in the quaint old Moorish
city of the same name, which stands between
the fortress and the harbor.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dan soon took his leave of his chum, going to
his own quarters for a short sleep before going
on duty at eight bells in the morning. Dave,
having opportunity to sleep until shortly before
breakfast, sat for some minutes pondering over
his strange meeting with Mr. Green Hat, whom
he now knew as Emil Gortchky, a notorious
international spy.</p>

<p>Still puzzling, Darrin turned out the light and
dropped into his berth. Once there the habit
of the service came strongly upon him. He
was between the sheets to sleep, so, with a final
sigh, he shut out thoughts of Mr. Green Hat, of
the admiral's remarks, and of the whole train
of events of the evening. Within a hundred and
twenty seconds he was sound asleep. It was an
orderly going the rounds in the early morning
who spoke to Ensign Darrin and awakened him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is the ship under way?" asked Dave, rolling
over and opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," responded the orderly, who
then wheeled and departed.</p>

<p>Dave was quickly out of his berth, and dressed
in time to join the gathering throng of the "Hudson's"
officers in the ward-room, where every
officer, except the captain, takes his meals.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the port for which we're
bound, Danny?" Darrin asked his chum.</p>

<p>"Not a word," replied Dalzell, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall find out at breakfast,"
commented Dave.</p>

<p>A minute later the signal came for the officers
to seat themselves. Then, after orders had been
given to the attentive Filipino boys, who served
as mess attendants, a buzz of conversation ran
around the table.</p>

<p>Soon the heavy, booming voice of Lieutenant
Commander Metson was heard as he asked
Commander Dawson, the executive officer:</p>

<p>"Sir, are we privileged to ask our port of
destination?"</p>

<p>This is a question often put to the executive
officer of a war vessel, for ninety-nine times out
of a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hunderd'">hundred</ins> he knows the answer. He <i>may</i>
smile and reply:</p>

<p>"I do not know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the executive officer, who is the
captain's confidential man, has good reasons for
not divulging the destination of the ship. In
that case his denial of knowledge is understood
to be only a courteous statement that he does
not deem it discreet to name the port of destination.</p>

<p>But in this instance Commander Dawson smiled
and replied:</p>

<p>"I will not make any secret of our destination
so far as I know it. We are bound for some port
on the Riviera. It may be Nice, or perhaps
Monte Carlo. I am informed that the admiral
has not yet decided definitely. I shall be quite
ready to tell you, Mr. Metson, as soon as I
know."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," courteously acknowledged
the lieutenant commander.</p>

<p>During this interval the buzz of conversation
had died down. It soon began again.</p>

<p>"The Riviera!" exclaimed Ensign Dalzell jubilantly,
though in a low tone intended mainly for
his chum's ear. "I have always wanted to see
that busy little strip of beach."</p>

<p>The Riviera, as will be seen by reference to a
map of Southern Europe, is a narrow strip of
land, between the mountains and the sea, running
around the Gulf of Genoa. One of the most
important watering places on this long strip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of beach is Nice, on French soil, where multitudes
of health and pleasure seekers flock annually.
The mild, nearly tropical climate of this place
in winter makes Nice one of the most attractive
resorts along the Riviera. Only a few miles
distant from Nice is the principality of Monte
Carlo, an independent state under a prince who
is absolute ruler of his tiny country. Monaco is
but two and a quarter miles long, while its width
varies from a hundred and sixty-five yards to
eleven hundred yards. Yet this "toy country"
is large enough to contain three towns of fair
size. The most noted town, Monte Carlo, stands
mainly on a cliff, and is the location of the most
notorious gambling resort in the world, the
"Casino."</p>

<p>"I wonder," suggested one of the younger
officers, in a rumbling voice, "if our Government
feels that we officers have more money than we
need, and so is sending us to a place where we
can get rid of it by gambling. What do you
say, Darrin?"</p>

<p>"Monte Carlo is one of the noted spots of the
world," Dave responded slowly, "and I shall be
glad to see a place of which I have heard and
read so much. But I shall not gamble at Monte
Carlo. I can make better use of my money and
of my character."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" agreed Totten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long is that strip of beach, the Riviera?"
asked one officer of Lieutenant Commander
Wales, the navigating officer.</p>

<p>"From Nice to Genoa, which is what is commonly
understood as the real Riviera," replied
the navigating officer; "the distance is one
hundred and sixteen miles. But, beyond Genoa,
on the other side, the beach continues for fifty-six
miles to Spezia. On the strip from Genoa to
Spezia the shore is so rocky that it has been
found necessary to construct eighty-odd tunnels
through the headlands for the railway that runs
the whole length of the Riviera."</p>

<p>Most of the talk, during that breakfast hour,
was about the Riviera, and much of that had to
do with Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>"For years I've wanted very particularly to see
that town of Monte Carlo," Danny Grin confessed.</p>

<p>"Not to gamble, I hope," replied Dave.</p>

<p>"Millions for sight-seeing, but not a cent for
gambling," Dalzell paraphrased lightly.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," warned Mr. Wales, "don't be
too certain that you'll see Monte Carlo on this
cruise. Often the weather is too rough for a
landing in that vicinity."</p>

<p>"And in that case?" queried Lieutenant Totten.</p>

<p>"In that case," replied Wales, "the usual
rule is for the ship to go on to anchorage in the
harbor at Genoa."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any one know whether the barometer is
talking about a storm?" Dalzell asked.</p>

<p>"That's a foolish question," remarked Lieutenant
Barnes grouchily.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Danny Grin, turning half around
and eyeing the last speaker. "You here?"</p>

<p>"As usual," nodded Barnes gruffly.</p>

<p>"What was that you said about a foolish
question?" demanded Dan.</p>

<p>"I was referring to your habit of asking foolish
questions," retorted Barnes.</p>

<p>"Do I ask any more of them than you do?"
Dalzell retorted, a bit gruffly.</p>

<p>"You do," Barnes declared, "and that's one of
them."</p>

<p>"If I thought I asked more foolish questions
than you do, sir," Dan rejoined, laying down his
coffee cup, "I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Dalzell paused.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" Barnes insisted.</p>

<p>"On second thought," Dan went on gravely,
"I don't believe I'll tell you. It was something
desperate that I was thinking of."</p>

<p>"Then drop the idea, Dalzell," scoffed Lieutenant
Barnes lightly. "You're hardly the
fellow we'd look to for desperate deeds."</p>

<p>"Oh, am I not?" demanded Dan, for once a
bit miffed.</p>

<p>Several of the officers glanced up apprehensively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
From necessity, life in the ward-room is an oppressively
close one at best. A feud between two
officers of the mess is enough to make all hands
uncomfortable much of the time.</p>

<p>"Cut it, Barnes," ordered the officer sitting on
the right-hand side of Lieutenant Barnes. "Don't
start any argument."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," broke in the paymaster, anxious
to change the topic of conversation, "have you
gone so far with your meal that a little bad news
won't spoil your appetites?"</p>

<p>Most of those present nodded, smilingly.</p>

<p>"Then," continued the paymaster, "I wish to
bring up a matter that has been discussed here
before. You all know that in some way, owing
to the carelessness of some one, there is an unexplained
shortage of thirty-three dollars in our
mess-fund. You appointed Totten and myself a
committee to look into the matter. We now beg
to report that the thirty-three dollars cannot be accounted
for. What is your pleasure in the matter?"</p>

<p>"I would call it very simple," replied Lieutenant
Commander Wales. "Why not levy an
assessment upon the members of this mess sufficient
to make up the thirty-three dollars? It will
amount to very little apiece."</p>

<p>That way of remedying the shortage would
have been agreed to promptly, had not Lieutenant
Barnes cut in eagerly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've a better plan for making up the shortage.
One man can pay it all, as a penalty, and there
will be a lot of fun in deciding which member
has to pay the penalty."</p>

<p>"What's the idea, Mr. Barnes?" asked the
executive officer.</p>

<p>"It's simple enough," Barnes went on, grinning.
"Let us set apart the dinner hour on Tuesday
evening, say. Every time this mess gets together
we hear a lot of foolish questions asked. Now,
on Tuesday evening, if any member of this mess
asks a question that he can't answer himself,
let it be agreed that he pay into the mess a fine
of thirty-three dollars to cover the shortage."</p>

<p>"It won't work," objected Totten. "Every
officer at this table will be on his guard not to
ask any questions at all."</p>

<p>"In that case," proposed Barnes, "let the rule
hold over on each successive Tuesday evening
until the victim is found and has paid his fine."</p>

<p>"It sounds like sport," agreed Dave Darrin.</p>

<p>"It will be sport to see the victim 'stung' and
made to pay up," grinned Dan Dalzell.</p>

<p>"And I think I know, already," contended
Lieutenant Barnes, "which officer will pay that
shortage."</p>

<p>"Are you looking at me with any particular
significance?" demanded Danny Grin.</p>

<p>"I am," Barnes admitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well, then, we shall see what we shall
see," quoth Dalzell, his color rising.</p>

<p>The scheme for fixing the thirty-three-dollar
penalty was quickly agreed upon. In fact, the
plan had in it many of the exciting elements of
a challenge.</p>

<p>Darrin left the mess to go on duty. Dan found
him presently.</p>

<p>"Say," murmured Danny Grin, in an aside,
"do you think Barnes will be very angry when
he pays over that thirty-three dollars?"</p>

<p>"I haven't yet heard that he is to pay it,"
Dave answered quietly.</p>

<p>"But he <i>is</i>," Dalzell asserted.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to make it my business," Dan went
on, "to see that Barnes is the victim of the very
scheme that he proposed. He will ask a question
that he can't answer, and he'll do it when Tuesday
evening comes around."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," Dave warned him.
"Barnes may not be exactly the most amiable
officer aboard, but at least he's a very keen chap.
If you are forming any plans for making Barnes
pay, look out, Dan, that your scheme doesn't
recoil upon yourself!"</p>

<p>"Wait and see," Dalzell insisted. "I tell you,
Barnes is going to pay that thirty-three dollars
into the mess treasury!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE STARTLER AT MONTE CARLO</h3>


<p>The frowning crags of Monaco confronted
the United States battleship "Hudson."</p>

<p>Here and there the rocky eminences
were broken by tiny strips of white beach. In
comparison with the crags the great, floating
fighting machine looked like a pigmy, indeed.</p>

<p>It was toward evening, and the day was Tuesday.
Darrin and Dalzell, both off duty for the
time being, strolled along the battleship's quarter-deck,
gazing shoreward.</p>

<p>"It's almost too bad that the times are so
civilized," murmured Danny Grin. "That little
toy principality would make an ideal pirates'
nest."</p>

<p>"I fancy Monaco has done duty enough in
that line in the past centuries," smiled Darrin.
"I have been reading up a bit on the history of
Monaco. Piracy flourished here as late as the
fourteenth century. Even rather late in the
eighteenth century every ship passing close to
this port had to pay toll. And to-day, through
its vast gambling establishments, visited by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
thousands every week, Monaco reaches out and
still takes its toll from all the world."</p>

<p>"It won't take any from me," smiled Dalzell.</p>

<p>"That is because you're a disciplined human
being, and you've too much character and honesty
to gamble," Darrin went on. "But think, with
a pitying sigh, of the thousands of poor wretches
who journey to Monaco, enter the Casino at
Monte Carlo, part with their money and their
honor, and then pass into one of the gardens,
there to blow their brains out.</p>

<p>"We shall get a glimpse of the place to-night,"
Dave continued. "I will admit that I have a
good deal of curiosity to see it. So I am glad
that we have shore leave effective after dinner.
Still, we shan't see anything like the crowd or the
picture that we might see if Europe were at
peace."</p>

<p>"This is Tuesday night," Dan warned his
chum.</p>

<p>"Yes; the night to avoid dangerous questions
at mess," Dave smiled. "Dan, are you still
going to try to catch Barnes?"</p>

<p>"Watch me," winked Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Look out, Dan! Such a trap may be set at
both ends."</p>

<p>But Dalzell winked once more, then allowed
his mouth to expand in that contortion which had
won him the nick name of "Danny Grin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave soon forgot Dalzell's threat of trouble for
the evening. It had passed out of his mind by
the time that Ensign Darrin entered the ward-room.
Yet soon after the officers had seated
themselves the executive officer announced:</p>

<p>"In the interest of fair play to all I deem it
best to warn you, gentlemen, that to-night is
the night when the first gentleman who asks a
question that he cannot himself answer is liable
to a penalty of thirty-three dollars to make up
the deficit in the mess treasury."</p>

<p>There were nods and grins, and shakings of
heads. Not an officer present had any idea that
<i>he</i> could be caught and made to pay the penalty.</p>

<p>As the meal progressed Lieutenant Commander
Wales finally turned to one of the Filipino waiters
and inquired:</p>

<p>"Is there any of the rare roast beef left?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know yourself, Wales?" demanded
Totten quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, er&mdash;no-o," admitted Mr. Wales, looking
much puzzled. "Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Then haven't you asked a question that you
can't answer?" demanded Totten mischievously.</p>

<p>"That's hardly a fair catch, is it?" demanded
the navigating officer, looking annoyed.</p>

<p>"It is not a fair catch," broke in the executive
officer incisively. "Any gentleman here has a
perfect right to ask the waiter questions about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the food supply without taking chances of being
subjected to a penalty."</p>

<p>"I bow to the decision, sir," replied Lieutenant
Totten. "I merely wished to have the question
settled."</p>

<p>Some of those present breathed more easily;
others yet dreaded to become victims of a penalty
proposition that many now regretted having
voted for.</p>

<p>As the dessert came on Dan Dalzell turned to
Dave.</p>

<p>"Darrin," he said, "can you tell me why it is
that a woodchuck never leaves any dirt heaped
up around the edge of his hole?"</p>

<p>Dave reflected, looking puzzled for a moment.
Then he shook his head as he answered:</p>

<p>"Dalzell, I'm afraid I don't know why."</p>

<p>"Of course <i>you</i> know why, Dalzell," broke in
Lieutenant Barnes warningly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do know," Dan replied, nodding
his head slowly. "However, perhaps some other
gentleman would like the chance of answering
the question."</p>

<p>Instantly a dozen at least of the officers became
interested in answering the question. To each
reply or guess, however, Dalzell shook his head.</p>

<p>"If everyone who wants it has had a try at
the answer," suggested the executive officer,
"then we will call upon Mr. Dalzell to inform us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
why a woodchuck, in digging his hole, leaves no
dirt piled up around the entrance."</p>

<p>There was silence while Dan replied easily:</p>

<p>"It's perfectly simple. Instead of beginning
at the surface of the ground and digging downward,
the woodchuck begins at the bottom of
the hole and digs up toward the light and air."</p>

<p>As Dalzell offered this explanation he faced
Lieutenant Barnes, who was eying him scoffingly.</p>

<p>When Dan had finished his explanation there
was a puzzled silence for an instant. But Dan's
half-leer irritated Lieutenant Barnes. Then came
the explosion.</p>

<p>"Shaw!" snorted Barnes. "That's an explanation
that doesn't explain anything. It's a fool
answer. How does the woodchuck, if he digs up
from the bottom of the hole, ever manage to get
to the bottom of the hole to make his start there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," answered Dan slowly, "that's
your question, Mr. Barnes."</p>

<p>"My question?" retorted the lieutenant.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If I understand aright," Dan went on, "you
asked how the woodchuck manages to get to the
bottom of the hole before he begins to dig."</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded the lieutenant, stiffly.</p>

<p>"That's just the idea," Dan grinned. "I am
calling upon you to answer the question that you
just asked. You must tell us how the woodchuck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
manages to get to the bottom of the hole
in order to start digging upward."</p>

<p>It required perhaps two seconds for the joke to
dawn on the other officers at the long mess table.
Then an explosion of laughter sounded, and every
eye was turned toward Lieutenant Barnes.</p>

<p>"That isn't fair!" roared the lieutenant, leaping
to his feet. "That was a trap! It wasn't a
fair catch."</p>

<p>Barnes's face was very red. His voice quivered
with indignation.</p>

<p>But Dan Dalzell was smiling coolly as he retorted:</p>

<p>"I'll leave it to the mess if Barnes hasn't
asked a question that he can't answer."</p>

<p>"You're caught, Barnes!" roared half a dozen
voices, and more laughter followed.</p>

<p>"You asked a question, Barnes, and you can't
answer it," came from others.</p>

<p>"That thirty-three dollars will come in handy,"
called another.</p>

<p>"Pay up like a man, Barnes."</p>

<p>"That's right. Pay up! You're caught."</p>

<p>The lieutenant's face grew redder, but he sat
down and tried to control his wrath.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem like a fairly incurred penalty,"
declared Barnes, as soon as he could make himself
heard, "but of course I'll abide by the decision
of the mess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I move," suggested Wales, "that we
leave the question to a committee of three to
decide whether Mr. Barnes has been properly
caught in the fine that he himself was the one
to propose. For committee I would suggest the
executive officer, the paymaster and the chaplain."</p>

<p>Informally that suggestion was quickly adopted.
The three officers named withdrew to a corner
of the ward-room, where they conversed in low
tones, after which they returned to their seats.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," announced the executive officer,
"the committee has discussed the problem submitted
to it, and the members of the committee
are unanimously agreed that Mr. Barnes fairly
and fully incurred the penalty that he himself
suggested the other morning."</p>

<p>Barnes snorted, but was quick to recover sufficiently
to bow in the direction of the executive
officer.</p>

<p>"Then I accept the decision, sir," announced
the lieutenant huskily. "At the close of the
meal I will pay thirty-three dollars into the
mess treasury."</p>

<p>Barnes tried to look comfortable, but he refused
to glance in the direction of Danny Grin.</p>

<p>"Did I catch him?" whispered Dalzell to his
chum.</p>

<p>"You did," Dave agreed quickly. "Barnes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
must feel pretty sore over the way his plan turned
out."</p>

<p>There was much laughter during the rest of
the meal, and Barnes had to stand for much
chaffing, which he bore with a somewhat sullen
look. As the officers rose none offered to leave
the ward-room. All stood by waiting to see Barnes
hand thirty-three dollars to the paymaster.</p>

<p>"Here is the money," announced Barnes, handing
a little wad of bills to the paymaster.</p>

<p>"Count it, Pay!" piped a voice from the rear
of the crowd, but it was not Dan who spoke.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Barnes had the grace to leave the
ward-room without stamping, but in the nearest
passageway he encountered Ensigns Darrin and
Dalzell.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are chuckling over the way I
dropped right into your trap," snapped Barnes
to Dan. "But do you call it a fair kind of trap?"</p>

<p>"What was the committee's decision on the
subject?" inquired Dan, softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll admit that the decision went against
me," answered the lieutenant, scowling. "How
will you like it if I promise to pay you back fully
for that trick? Are you willing that I should?"</p>

<p>"If your mind is set on paying me back,"
Danny Grin responded, "then my willingness
would have very little to do with your conduct.
But I am willing to make you a promise, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the lieutenant, quite
testily.</p>

<p>"If you attempt to pay me back, sir, and
succeed, I'll agree to take my medicine with an
appearance of greater good humor than you
displayed a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Huh!" sniffed Mr. Barnes.</p>

<p>"Danny boy," broke in Dave, "I don't want
to spoil a pleasant conversation, but I would like
to remind you that, if we are to make much of
our evening ashore, we shall do well to change
to 'cits' at once. The launch leaves the side in
fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me, won't you, sir?" begged
Dalzell, favoring the lieutenant with an extremely
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>The chums went to their respective cabins,
where they quickly made the change from uniform
to citizen's dress, commonly called "cits."</p>

<p>Promptly the launch left the "Hudson's"
side, but both young ensigns were aboard. At
least a dozen other officers and a score of seamen
were also aboard the launch, which was to return
for forty more seamen who held the coveted
shore leave.</p>

<p>Yet the reader is not to suppose that either
officers or men were going ashore with any notion
of gambling. An American naval officer, with
his status of "officer and gentleman," would risk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a severe rebuke from his commanding officer if
he were to seat himself to play in any gambling
resort. As for the enlisted men, the "jackies,"
they are not of the same piece of cloth as the
jovial, carousing seamen of the old-time Navy.
The "jackies" of to-day are nearly all extremely
youthful; they are clean-cut, able, ambitious
young fellows, much more inclined to study than
to waste their time in improper resorts.</p>

<p>So, while most of the officers and men now
going ashore were likely to drop in at the Casino,
for the sake of seeing the sights there, it was
not in the least to be feared that any would
engage in the gambling games.</p>

<p>When the launch landed in the little harbor,
drivers of automobiles and carriages clamored
for fares.</p>

<p>"Are we going to ride up to the Casino?" Dan
asked his chum.</p>

<p>"If you'd rather," Dave assented. "But,
unless you feel tired, let us stroll along and see
every bit of the way."</p>

<p>"These natives are all jabbering French,"
complained Dalzell, as the chums set out to
walk over the steep, well-worn roads, "but it
isn't the kind of French we were taught at
Annapolis."</p>

<p>"Can't you understand them?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"Hardly a word."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you have to talk with any of the natives,"
Dave advised, "speak your French slowly,
and ask the person you're addressing to do
the same."</p>

<p>Though the way was steep, it was not a long
road. Dave and Dan soon reached the upper,
rocky plain, edged by cliffs, on which the Casino
and some of the hotels and other buildings stand.</p>

<p>"If it weren't for the gambling," murmured
Dan to his friend, "I'd call this a beautiful
enough spot to live and die in."</p>

<p>"As it is, a good many men and women manage
to die here," Darrin returned gravely.</p>

<p>The Casino was surrounded by beautiful gardens,
in which were many rare tropical trees and
shrubs. From the Casino came the sound of
orchestral music. Throngs moved about on the
verandas; couples or little groups strolled through
the gardens. Inside, the play had hardly begun.
Gambling does not reach its frantic height until
midnight.</p>

<p>"We shall feel out of place," mused Dave aloud.
"Dan, we really should have known better than
to come here in anything but evening dress. You
see that every one else is in full regalia."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better keep on the edge of the
crowd," responded Danny Grin. "There is
enough to be seen here, for one evening, without
entering the Casino."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Dave intended to enter the Casino
later, he decided, for the present, to take in the
full beauty of the night in the gardens. There
were electric lights everywhere, which outshone
the brilliance of the moon.</p>

<p>"Hello!" whispered Dan, suddenly. "There's
an old friend of ours."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Green Hat," Dan whispered impressively.</p>

<p>Instantly Dave Darrin became intensely interested,
though he had no intimation of what
this second meeting portended. That Mr. Green
Hat was destined to play a highly tragic r&ocirc;le in
his life, Darrin, of course, had no inkling at that
moment.</p>

<p>"There he is!" whispered Dalzell, pointing, as
the chums stood screened by a flowering bush.</p>

<p>"We'll watch that rascal!" Dave proposed
promptly. "I wonder if he has followed the
'Hudson' here with a view to attempting more
mischief against our Government. Whatever
his game is, I am going to take a peep at the
inside of it if a chance comes my way!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MR. GREEN HAT'S NEW R&Ocirc;LE</h3>


<p>Mr. Green Hat, on this occasion, had
discarded the article of headwear that
had given him that nickname with the
young ensigns.</p>

<p>Instead, Gortchky wore an opera hat, with
evening dress of the most fashionable description.
On his broad white expanse of vest there glittered
a foreign decoration.</p>

<p>Though he walked alone, and affected an air
of indifference to his surroundings, Darrin was
of the impression that the spy was looking alertly
for some one.</p>

<p>"Of course it may happen," said Dave to his
friend, "that the fellow is foolish enough to come
here for the purpose of throwing away at the
gaming tables the money he earns by his questionable
services to some plotting international
ring. Yet that seems hardly likely, either, for
Gortchky must be a man of tremendous energy,
to render the thrilling services that are demanded
of a spy or an international trouble-maker."</p>

<p>Now the two chums left the place where they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
had been standing behind the bush, to stroll
along slowly, all the while keeping Gortchky in
sight.</p>

<p>Dave nudged his chum as, at a turn in the
path, the spy came face to face with a woman
clad in a beautiful evening gown.</p>

<p>Raising his hat, and making a courteous bow
to the woman, who returned the greeting, Gortchky
exchanged half a dozen sentences with her. Then
the pair separated, though not before Dave and
Dan had obtained, under the electric light, a
good view of the young woman's face. Her
dark beauty, her height and grace, gave her a
queenly air.</p>

<p>Stepping into another path, Dave and Dan
were soon on the trail of Gortchky once more,
without having been obliged to pass the young
woman face to face.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she's a 'spy-ess'?" murmured
Dan.</p>

<p>"It is just as well to be suspicious of any one
whom Gortchky appears to know well," Dave
answered, slowly, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir," broke in a sailor from the
"Hudson," stepping forward and saluting the
officers. "May I speak with you, sir?"</p>

<p>It was Dan to whom he spoke, and it was Dan
who answered:</p>

<p>"Certainly, Martin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 263px;">
<img src="images/illus-054.jpg" width="263" height="400" alt="&quot;The spy came face to face with a woman.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The spy came face to face with a woman.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Martin was one of the gun-pointers in Dalzell's
division.</p>

<p>"Linton, one of our men, has been hurt, and
rather badly, by falling off a boulder that he
climbed not far from here, sir. I thought I
would ask the ensign what to do with Linton."</p>

<p>"How badly is he hurt?" asked Ensign Dalzell.</p>

<p>"I think his right leg is broken, sir. Colby
is with him, and I came in search of you, sir,
as I was certain I saw you here."</p>

<p>"Is Linton far from here?" asked Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Less than a quarter of a mile, sir."</p>

<p>"Lead the way, Martin, and I'll follow you.
Dave, you'll excuse me for a little while, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," nodded Ensign Darrin. Dave
wished to remain where he was, in order to keep
an eye over Gortchky's movements, and Dan
knew it. So the chums parted for the present.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll see if I can pick up Gortchky again,"
reflected Ensign Darrin. "He appears to have
given me the slip."</p>

<p>Dave went ahead, more briskly than he had
been moving before, in the hope of sighting the
spy.</p>

<p>Out of the Casino had staggered a young man,
despair written on his face, hopelessness in his
very air. Plunging into the garden this stranger
made his way hastily through it, keeping on until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he came to the field where pigeon shoots are held
from time to time.</p>

<p>Dave, at the edge of the garden, saw the
young man step past the shrubbery and go on into
the darkness beyond. Under the last rays of
light Ensign Darrin saw something glitter in the
stranger's hand.</p>

<p>"That fellow has just drawn a revolver!"
flashed through Darrin's mind. "Now, what
mischief can he be up to?"</p>

<p>Led onward by some fascination that he did
not understand, the young naval officer followed.</p>

<p>In his excitement and desperation the man
did not notice that he was being followed.</p>

<p>Halting under the heavy foliage of a tree, the
stranger glanced down at the weapon in his
hand and shuddered. This foolish young man,
haunting the gambling tables until he had ruined
himself, and seeing nothing now ahead of him in
life, was bent upon self-destruction.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are several such suicides at
Monte Carlo in a single week. If unprovided
with other means for ending his life, the suicide
sometimes hurls himself over the edge of one of
the steep cliffs.</p>

<p>Suicides, of course, have a depressing effect on
other players, so those in authority at the Casino
take every means of hushing up these tragedies
as effectively as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is really nothing left in life," muttered
the young man huskily, as he stared at the
weapon in his hand. He spoke in French, but
Darrin heard and understood him.</p>

<p>Then the desperate one raised the weapon,
pointing the muzzle at his head.</p>

<p>At that instant there was a quick step out of
the darkness, and Dave reached the stranger.
The latter, startled, drew back, but not in time
to prevent Darrin's grip of steel from resting on
his right wrist.</p>

<p>Wrench! Dave had the pistol in his own
hands, at the same time murmuring:</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, I trust."</p>

<p>Ensign Darrin broke the weapon open at the
breach. From the chamber he removed the
cartridges, dropping them into his pocket. With
another swift movement Dave flung the pistol
so far that it dropped over the edge of a cliff.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, I trust, sir, for throwing
your property away in that fashion," Dave
apologized, in the best French he could summon.</p>

<p>"Since it is the very last item of my property
that was left to me, perhaps it can matter but
little that I am deprived of it," said the stranger,
smiling wanly. "The cliff is still left to me,
however. I can easily follow the pistol."</p>

<p>"But you are not going to jump over the cliff,"
Darrin assured him energetically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why are you so certain of that?" demanded
the stranger.</p>

<p>Dave looked keenly at his companion before
he replied:</p>

<p>"Because, sir, your face is that of a man&mdash;not
of a coward. Suicide is the act of a coward.
It is the resort of one who frankly admits that
his troubles are greater than he has the manhood
to bear. Now, you have, when one regards
you closely, the look of a man and a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your good opinion, sir," replied
the stranger, bowing. "I will say that I
was born a gentleman."</p>

<p>"And you still are one, and a man, as well as
a gentleman," Dave continued, gently. "Therefore,
you are not afraid to face life."</p>

<p>"What is there left to me to make life worth
living?" queried the stranger.</p>

<p>"Why should you have the least desire to die?"
Dave countered.</p>

<p>"I have lost all my money."</p>

<p>"That is a very slight matter," Darrin argued.
"Lost all your money, have you? Why, my dear
fellow, there's a lot more in the world."</p>

<p>"But none of the money now in the world is
mine," urged the desperate one.</p>

<p>"Then make a part of the world's money yours,"
the young naval officer retorted, smilingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have never worked," replied the stranger
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Dave pressed.</p>

<p>"I never had need to."</p>

<p>"But now you have the need, and working for
money will bring some novelty into your life,"
the young ensign insisted.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you that I was born a gentleman?"
inquired the young man, raising his eyebrows.
"A gentleman never works!"</p>

<p>"Some gentlemen don't," Dave admitted. "But
they are the wrong kind of gentlemen."</p>

<p>"If I mistake not," quizzed the stranger keenly,
"you are a gentleman, yourself."</p>

<p>"I trust that I am," Dave responded gravely.</p>

<p>"Then do you work?"</p>

<p>"More hours a day than any laborer does," Darrin
answered promptly. "I am a naval officer."</p>

<p>"Ah, but that is a career of honor&mdash;of glory!"
cried the stranger.</p>

<p>"And so is any honest job of work that a man
takes up in earnest and carries through to the best
of his ability," Dave Darrin returned with warmth.</p>

<p>"But you see, sir," argued the stranger, though
now he was smiling, "you have been trained to
a profession. I never was so trained."</p>

<p>"You are young?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four."</p>

<p>"Then you are young enough to change your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
mind and recognize the dignity of labor," Darrin
continued. "You are also young enough and,
unless I mistake you, bright enough to win a
very good place in life for yourself. And you
are man enough, now you have had time to
think it over, to see the wickedness of destroying
yourself. Man, <i>make</i> yourself instead."</p>

<p>"I'll do it! I will make myself!" promised
the stranger, with a new outburst of emotion.</p>

<p>"And you will never again allow yourself to
become so downcast that you will seek to destroy
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," Dave said gravely. "You are
a man of honor, and therefore are incapable of
breaking your word. Your hand!"</p>

<p>Their hands met in ardent clasp. Then Darrin
took out his card case, tendering his card to the
stranger.</p>

<p>Instantly the young man produced his own card
case, and extended a bit of pasteboard, murmuring:</p>

<p>"I am M. le Comte de Surigny, of Lyons,
France."</p>

<p>It was too dark to read the cards there, but
Dave gave his own name, and again the young
men shook hands.</p>

<p>"But I am forgetting my comrade," Dave
cried suddenly. "He was to return in a few
minutes, and will not know where to find me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I have detained you, with my own
wretched affairs!" cried the young count reproachfully.
"I must not trespass upon your
time another second."</p>

<p>"Why not walk along with me and meet my
friend?" Dave suggested.</p>

<p>"With pleasure."</p>

<p>Dave and the young French count stepped
along briskly until they came to the spot where
Dalzell had left his chum. Two or three minutes
later Dan hove into sight.</p>

<p>Dan and the Count of Surigny were introduced,
and some chat followed. Then the Count frankly
told of the service that Darrin had just rendered
him.</p>

<p>"That is Dave!" glowed Dan. "He's always
around in time to be of use to some one."</p>

<p>In the distance a shot rang out&mdash;only one.
The Count of Surigny shuddered.</p>

<p>"You understand, do you not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," Dave sadly responded.</p>

<p>As they stood there four men with a litter
hurried past toward the place whence the sound
of the shot had come.</p>

<p>"The police of Monte Carlo," murmured the
Count of Surigny.</p>

<p>Presently, at a distance, the three onlookers
beheld the four men and the litter moving stealthily
along, but not toward the Casino. The litter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was occupied by a still form over which a cover
had been thrown.</p>

<p>"You have shown me the way of true courage!"
murmured the Count of Surigny, laying an
affectionate hand on Ensign Darrin's shoulder.</p>

<p>The chums and their new acquaintance strolled
along for a few moments. Then the Count suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But I am intruding, and must leave you."</p>

<p>"You surely are not intruding," Dave told
him. "We are delighted with your company."</p>

<p>"Wholly so," Dan added.</p>

<p>But the Count felt himself to be an interloper,
and so insisted on shaking hands again and
taking his departure.</p>

<p>"I shall see or write you presently," said the
Count. He had already obtained the fleet address,
and knew, in addition, that he could write at
any time through the Navy Department at
Washington.</p>

<p>"Will he make good?" asked Danny Grin
wistfully, as he peered after the departing form.</p>

<p>"It's an even chance," Dave replied. "Either
that young man will go steadily up, or else he
will go rapidly down. It is sometimes a terrible
thing to be born a gentleman&mdash;in the European
sense. Few of the Count's friends will appreciate
him if he starts in upon a career of effort. But,
even though he goes down, he will struggle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bravely at the outset. Of that I feel certain."</p>

<p>"I wonder what has become of Gortchky?"
remarked Ensign Dalzell.</p>

<p>That industrious spy, however, was no longer
the pursued; he had become the pursuer.</p>

<p>From a little distance Gortchky had espied
Dave and the Count chatting, and had witnessed
the introduction to Dalzell. A man of Mr.
Green Hat's experience with the world did not
need many glances to assure himself that the
Count had lost his last franc at the gambling
table.</p>

<p>Gortchky was not at Monte Carlo without
abundant assistance. So, as the Count, head
down, and reflecting hard, strolled along one of
the paths, a man bumped into him violently.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pardons, Monsieur!" cried the
bumper, in a tone of great embarrassment. "It
was stupid of me. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have no uneasiness, my friend," smiled the
Count. "It was I who was stupid. I should have
looked where I was going."</p>

<p>Courteous bows were exchanged, and the two
separated. But the man who had bumped into
the Count now carried inside his sleeve the Count's
empty wallet, which was adorned with the crest
of Surigny.</p>

<p>This wallet was promptly delivered to another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Five minutes later, as the Count strolled along,
Emil Gortchky called out behind him:</p>

<p>"Monsieur! Pardon me, but I think you must
have dropped your wallet."</p>

<p>"If I have, the loss is trifling indeed," smiled
the Count, turning.</p>

<p>Gortchky held out the wallet, then struck a
match. By the flame the Count beheld his own
crest.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is mine," replied the Count, "and I
thank you for your kindness."</p>

<p>"Will Monsieur do me the kindness, before
I leave him, to make sure that the contents of
the wallet are intact?" urged Gortchky.</p>

<p>"It will take but an instant," laughed the
Count of Surigny. "See! I will show you that
the contents are intact!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he opened the wallet. A packet
of paper dropped to the ground. In astonishment
the Count bent over to pick up the packet.
M. Gortchky struck another match.</p>

<p>"Let us go nearer to an electric light, that
you may count your money at your ease,
Monsieur," suggested Gortchky.</p>

<p>Like one in a daze the Count moved along with
Gortchky. When sufficiently in the light, Surigny,
with an expression of astonishment, found that
he was the possessor of thirty twenty-franc
notes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not know that I had this!" cried the
Count. "How did I come to overlook it?"</p>

<p>"It is but a trifle to a man of your fortune,"
cried M. Gortchky gayly.</p>

<p>"It is all I have in the world!" sighed the
young man. "And I am still amazed that I
possess so much."</p>

<p>"Poor?" asked Gortchky, in a voice vibrating
with sympathy. "And you so young, and a
gentleman of old family! Monsieur, it may be
that this is a happy meeting. Perhaps I may be
able to offer you the employment that befits a
gentleman."</p>

<p>Then Gortchky lowered his voice, almost
whispering:</p>

<p>"For I am in the diplomatic service, and have
need of just such an attach&eacute; as you would make.
Young, a gentleman, and of charming manners!
Your intellect, too, I am sure, is one that would
fit you for eminence in the diplomatic service."</p>

<p>"The mere mention of the diplomatic service
attracts me," confessed M. le Comte wistfully.</p>

<p>"Then you shall have your fling at it!" promised
M. Gortchky. "But enough of this. You shall
talk it over with me to-morrow. Diplomacy,
you know, is all gamble, and the gambler makes
the best diplomat in the world. For to-night,
Monsieur, you shall enjoy yourself! If I know
anything of gaming fate, then you are due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
reap a harvest of thousands with your few
francs to-night. I can see it in your face that
your luck is about to turn. An evening of calm,
quiet play, Monsieur, and in the morning you
and I will arrange for your entrance into the
diplomatic world. <i>Faites votre jeux!</i> (Make your
wagers.) Wealth to-night, and a career to-morrow!
Come! To the Casino!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>DANNY GRIN FIGHTS A SMILE</h3>


<p>Side by side Dave and Dan strolled through
the vast main salon of the Casino.</p>

<p>Here at tables were groups of men and
women. Each player hoped to quit the tables
that night richer by thousands. Most of them
were doomed to leave poorer, as chance is always
in favor of the gambling institution and always
against the player.</p>

<p>"It's a mad scene," murmured Dan, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"You are looking on now at an exhibition of
what is probably the worst, and therefore the
most dangerous, human vice," Dave replied.
"Bad as drunkenness is, gambling is worse."</p>

<p>"What is at the bottom of the gambling
mania?" Dan asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Greed," Dave responded promptly. "The
desire to possess property, and to acquire it
without working for it."</p>

<p>"Some of these poor men and women look as
if they were working hard indeed," muttered
Dan, in almost a tone of sympathy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are not working so much as suffering,"
Dave rejoined. "Study their faces, Danny boy.
Can't you see greed sticking out all over these
countenances? Look at the hectic flush in most
of the faces. And&mdash;look at that man!"</p>

<p>A short, stout man sprang up from a table, his
face ghastly pale and distorted as though with
terror. His eyes were wild and staring. He
chattered incoherently as he hastened away with
tottering steps. Then his hands gripped his
hair, as though about to tear it from his head.</p>

<p>A few of the players in this international congress
of greed glanced at the unfortunate man,
who probably had just beggared himself, shrugged
their shoulders, and turned their fascinated eyes
back to the gambling table.</p>

<p>One woman, young and charming, reached up
to her throat, unfastening and tossing on the
table a costly diamond necklace and pendant.</p>

<p>"Now," she laughed hysterically, "I may go on
playing for another hour."</p>

<p>The Casino's representative in charge at that
table smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"We accept only money, madame," he said,
with a grave bow.</p>

<p>"But I have no more money&mdash;with me,"
flashed back the young woman, her cheeks
burning feverishly.</p>

<p>"I regret, madame," insisted the Casino's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
man. Then an attendant, at a barely perceptible
sign from the <i>croupier</i>, as the man in charge of
the table is called, stepped up behind the young
woman, bent over her and murmured:</p>

<p>"If you care to leave the table for a few minutes,
madame, there are those close at hand who will
advance you money on your necklace."</p>

<p>The young woman pouted at first. In another
instant there was a suppressed shout at the table.
A player had just won four thousand francs.</p>

<p>"I must have money!" cried the young woman,
springing from her chair. "This is destined to
be my lucky night, and I must have money!"</p>

<p>As though he had been waiting for his prey,
the attendant was quickly by the woman's side.
Bowing, he offered his arm. The man, attendant
though he was, was garbed in evening dress.
Without a blush the woman moved away on this
attendant's arm.</p>

<p>"Shall we move on?" asked Dan.</p>

<p>"Not just yet," urged Darrin, in an undertone.
"I am interested in the further fate of
that foolish young woman."</p>

<p>Within five minutes she had returned. Her
former seat had been reserved for her; the young
woman dropped into it.</p>

<p>"You have enough money now?" asked the
woman at her left.</p>

<p>"I have money," pouted the pretty young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
woman, "but be warned by me. The pawnbrokers
at Monte Carlo are robbers. The fellow would
advance me only six thousand francs, whereas
my husband paid a hundred thousand for that
necklace."</p>

<p>A moment later the young woman was absorbed
in the wild frenzy of play.</p>

<p>"And that attendant undoubtedly gets a handsome
commission from the pawnbroker," murmured
Darrin in his chum's ear. "Greed here is
in the very air; none can escape it who lingers."</p>

<p>"How much have you lost, Darrin?" called a
bantering voice in Dave's ear.</p>

<p>The speaker was Lieutenant Totten.</p>

<p>"About as much, I imagine, as you have, sir,"
was Darrin's smiling answer.</p>

<p>"Meaning that you now have as much money
as when you entered the place?" answered the
lieutenant, banteringly.</p>

<p>"Exactly," returned Darrin. "I have only to
study the faces here to know better than to risk
even a franc-piece at one of these tables."</p>

<p>"And you, Dalzell?" inquired Totten.</p>

<p>"I haven't any French money, anyway,"
grinned Dan.</p>

<p>"Not at all necessary to have French money,"
laughed Totten. "Any kind of real money is
good here&mdash;as long as it lasts. Every nation
on earth is represented here to-night, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
attendants know the current exchange rate for
any kind of good money that is coined or printed.
Look closely about you and you will see other
things that are worth nothing. There are men
here, some of them limping, others showing the
pallor of illness, who are undoubtedly French,
English or Italian officers, injured at the front
and sent home to hospitals. Being still unfitted
to return to their soldier duties at the front, they
are passing time here and indulging in their
mania for gambling. And here, too, you will see
wealthy French, Italian, English or Russian
civilians who have returned to Monte Carlo to
gamble, though later on they are pretty certain
to be held up to contempt at home for gambling
money away here instead of buying government
war bonds at home."</p>

<p>"You have been here before?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," nodded Totten, "and as I do not
play, and would not do so in any circumstances,
this place has not much interest for me."</p>

<p>"I can hardly imagine," said Ensign Darrin,
gravely, "that I shall ever bother to pay a second
visit here."</p>

<p>"It's a good deal of a bore," yawned Lieutenant
Totten, behind his hand. "I am glad to note
that most of the people here look like Europeans.
I should hate to believe that many Americans
could be foolish enough to come here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment a stout, red-faced man rose
from a table near by, his voice booming as he
laughed:</p>

<p>"I have lost only sixteen thousand francs. I
shall be sure to come back and have my
revenge. In Chicago my signature is good at
any time for a million dollars&mdash;for five million
francs!"</p>

<p>Many eyes, followed this speaker wistfully.
With such wealth as his how many months of
frenzied pleasure they might have at Monte
Carlo!</p>

<p>"One American idiot, at least," muttered Totten,
in disgust. "Or else he's a liar or braggart."</p>

<p>Madly the play went on, the faces of the players
growing more flushed as the hour grew later.</p>

<p>Totten moved along with a bored air.</p>

<p>"I guess he's going," said Dan. "I don't
blame him for being tired of the place. It's
like a human menagerie."</p>

<p>"We'll go, then," agreed Dave. "Surely I
have seen enough of the Casino. I shall never
care to revisit it."</p>

<p>"Ah, here you are, my dear fellows!" exclaimed
a musical voice. "And the Countess Ripoli has
asked me to present you to her. She is eager to
know if you American officers are as wonderful
as I have told her."</p>

<p>The speaker was Dandelli, a handsome, boyish-looking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
frank-faced young Italian naval officer
with whom Darrin and Dalzell had become
acquainted at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The Countess Ripoli, to whom Dandelli now
presented the two young ensigns, was a woman
in the full flower of her beauty at twenty-five
or so. Tall, willowy, with a perfect air, her
wonderful eyes, in which there was a touch of
Moorish fire, were calculated to set a young
man's heart to beating responses to her mood.
Attired in the latest mode of Paris, and wearing
only enough jewels to enhance her great beauty,
the Countess chose to be most gracious to the
young ensigns. Dave thought her a charming
young woman; Dan Dalzell nearly lost his head.</p>

<p>From a distance Emil Gortchky looked on, a
quiet smile gleaming in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Dandelli is a fool, who will do any pretty
woman's bidding," mused the spy. "Madame
Ripoli can play with him. Also I believe she
will surely ensnare for me at least one of the
Americans. Which, I wonder? But then why
should I care which? The Ripoli knows how to
manage such affairs far better than I do."</p>

<p>For the Countess was another of the many
dangerous tools with which Mr. Green Hat plied
his wicked trade.</p>

<p>If the Countess, as unscrupulous as Gortchky
himself, could ensnare either of these young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
officers with her fascinations, he was likely to
be that much the weaker, and a readier prey for
the trap that Emil Gortchky was arranging.</p>

<p>"Dandelli," murmured the Countess sweetly,
in French, "you will wish, I know, to talk with
your dear friend, Mr. Darrin, so I must look to
Mr. Dalzell to offer me his arm."</p>

<p>Dan was ready, with a bow, to offer the Countess
Ripoli his arm, and to escort her in the direction
which she indicated.</p>

<p>It was to one of the verandas that the Countess
led the way. As she chatted she laughed and
looked up at Dan with her most engaging expression.
There were other promenaders on the
veranda, though not many, for the furious fascination
of gambling tables kept nearly all the
frequenters of the place inside.</p>

<p>"You have played to-night?" asked the
Countess, again glancing sweetly up into the
young naval officer's face.</p>

<p>"Not to-night," Dan replied.</p>

<p>"But you will doubtless play later?" she
insisted.</p>

<p>"I haven't gambled to-night, nor shall I gamble
on any other night," Dan replied pleasantly.</p>

<p>"But why?" demanded the Countess, looking
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Gambling does not fit in with my idea of
honesty," replied Dalzell quite bluntly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>DAVE RUNS INTO A REAL THRILL</h3>


<p>"I do not understand," murmured the Countess.</p>

<p>"I know that the European idea of gambling
is very different from that entertained by
most people in my country," Dan went on pleasantly.
"To the greater number of Americans,
gambling is a method of getting other people's
money away from them without working for it."</p>

<p>"And that is why you term it dishonest?"
asked the Countess.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dan frankly. "And, in addition,
it is a wicked waste of time that could be
put to so many good uses."</p>

<p>Countess Ripoli shrugged her fine shoulders,
and looked up once more at the young officer.
But Dan was smiling back coolly at her.</p>

<p>"You have not a flattering idea of the Europeans?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Quite to the contrary," Dan assured her.</p>

<p>"Yet you think we are both weak and dishonest,
because we use our time to poor advantage
and because so many of us find Monte Carlo
delightful?" she pressed him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not all Europeans frequent Monte Carlo,"
Dalzell answered.</p>

<p>"May I ask my new American friend why <i>he</i>
should waste his time here?" laughed the Countess.</p>

<p>"I do not believe I have exactly wasted my
time," Dan replied. "A naval officer, or any
other American, may well spend some of his
time here in gaining a better knowledge of human
nature. Surely, there is much of human
nature to be seen here, even though it be not one
of the better sides."</p>

<p>"What is the bad trait, or the vice, that one beholds
most at Monte Carlo?" the Countess asked.</p>

<p>"Greed," Dan rejoined promptly.</p>

<p>"And dishonesty?"</p>

<p>"Much of that vice, no doubt," Dan continued.
"To-night there must be many a man here who
is throwing away money that his family needs,
yet he will never tell his wife that he lost his
money over a table at Monte Carlo. Again,
there must be many a woman here throwing
away money in large sums, and she, very likely,
will never tell her husband the truth. Let us
say that, in both sexes, there are a hundred
persons here to-night who will be dishonest
toward their life partners afterward. And then,
perhaps, many a young bachelor, who, betrothed
to some good woman, is learning his first lessons
in greed and deceit. And some young girls, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
who are perhaps learning the wrong lessons in
life. I know of one very young man here who
tried to blow out his brains to-night. For the
sake of a few hours, or perhaps a few weeks,
over the gaming tables of Monte Carlo, he had
thrown away everything that made life worth
living. Any man who gambles bids good-by to
the finer things of life."</p>

<p>Dan's slow, halting French made the Countess
listen very attentively, that she might understand
just what he said. She puckered her brow
thoughtfully, then suddenly glanced up, laughing
with all the witchery at her command.</p>

<p>"Then, my dear American," she said insinuatingly,
"I fear that you are going to refuse me
a very great favor."</p>

<p>"I hope not," Dan replied, gallantly.</p>

<p>"There is," pursued the Countess, "such a
thing as luck. Often a prophecy of that luck is
to be seen in one's face. I see such luck written
in your face now. Since you will not play for
yourself, I had hoped that you would be willing
to let me have the benefit of a little of the luck
that is so plainly written on your face. I had
hoped, up to this instant, that you would consent
to play as my proxy."</p>

<p>The Countess was looking at him in a way that
would have melted many a man into agreeing
to her wishes, but Dan answered promptly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I regret, Countess, to be compelled to refuse
your request, but I would not play for myself,
nor for anyone else."</p>

<p>"If you so detest Monte Carlo and its pursuits,"
replied the Countess with a pout, "I cannot
understand why you are here."</p>

<p>"There was something useful to be gained
from witnessing the sights here, but I have seen
as much as I wish," Dalzell went on, "and now
I am ready to leave. I am returning to my ship
as soon as Darrin is ready to go."</p>

<p>"And he, also, is tired of Monte Carlo?" asked
Countess Ripoli.</p>

<p>"Darrin's views are much the same as my
own," Dan responded quietly.</p>

<p>Countess Ripoli bit her lip, then surveyed
Dalzell with a sidelong look which she did not
believe he saw, but Dan, trained in habits of
observation, had missed nothing.</p>

<p>"Will you take me back to the tables?" asked
the Countess suddenly.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," bowed Dan.</p>

<p>Lightly resting a hand on his arm the Countess
guided Dalzell rather than walked with him.
Back into the largest salon they moved.</p>

<p>Dan's eye roved about in search of Darrin,
but that young ensign was not in sight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At that very moment, in fact, Dave Darrin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was very much concerned in a matter upon
which he had stumbled.</p>

<p>A few moments before his quick eye had espied
Emil Gortchky crossing the room at a distance.
Gortchky paused barely more than a few seconds
to say a few words to a white-bearded, rather
distinguished-looking foreigner. The older man
returned Gortchky's look, then smiled slightly
and moved on.</p>

<p>It was a trivial incident, but it was sufficient
to set Dave's mind to working swiftly, on account
of what he already knew about Mr. Green Hat.</p>

<p>For a few moments longer Ensign Darrin stood
where he was; then, tiring of the scene, and wondering
what had become of Danny Grin, he moved
out upon one of the verandas, strolling slowly
along. Reaching a darker part of the veranda,
where a clump of small potted trees formed a
toy grove, Dave paused, looking past the trees
out upon the vague glimpses to be had of the
Mediterranean by night.</p>

<p>There, in the near distance, gleamed the lights
of the "Hudson." Darrin's face glowed with
pride in the ship and in the Nation that stood
behind her.</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously he stepped inside the
little grove. For a few minutes longer his gaze
rested on the sea. Then, hearing voices faintly,
he turned to see if Dalzell were approaching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead, it was the white-bearded foreigner,
the murmur of whose voice had reached him.
With him was another man, younger, black-haired,
and with a face that somehow made the
beholder think of an eagle.</p>

<p>The two men were engaged in close, low-voiced
conversation.</p>

<p>"I'd better step into view," reflected Darrin,
"so that they may not talk of private matters
in my hearing."</p>

<p>Just then a chuckle escaped the younger of
the pair, and with it Dave distinguished the word,
"American."</p>

<p>It was the sneering intonation given the word
that made Dave Darrin start slightly.</p>

<p>"Those men are discussing my country,"
muttered the young ensign, swiftly, "and one
of them at least is well acquainted with that
spy, Gortchky. Perhaps I shall do better to
remain where I am."</p>

<p>Nor had Dave long to deliberate on this point,
for the pair now neared the grove. They were
speaking French, and in undertones, but Dave's
ear was quick for that tongue, and he caught the
words:</p>

<p>"England's friendship is important to America
at the present moment, and it is very freely
given, too. The English believe in their Yankee
cousins."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"When the English lose a naval ship or two
at Malta or elsewhere, and learn that it is the
Americans who sink their ships, and then lie
about it, will the English love for America be
as great?" laughed the younger man.</p>

<p>"The English will be furious," smiled the white-bearded
man, "and they will never learn the
truth, either. For a hundred years to come Great
Britain will hate the United States with the
fiercest hatred."</p>

<p>"It is a desperate trick, but a clever one,"
declared the younger man, admiringly. "Nor
will there be any way for either England or
America to learn the truth. The whole world
will know that the Yankees destroyed two British
ships with all on board. It will probably bring
the two countries to actual war. No matter
though England is at present engaged in a huge
war, the sentiment of her people would force her
to take the United States on, too."</p>

<p>Ensign Dave Darrin, overhearing that conversation,
and well knowing that he was listening to
more than vaporing, felt his face blanch. He
steeled himself to rigid posture as he felt himself
trembling slightly.</p>

<p>Farther down the veranda strolled the French-speaking
pair, then wheeled out of sight.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Dave strode silently, swiftly
toward the salon that he had left. As he stepped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
into the brighter light, with admirable control,
he slowed down to a sauntering stroll, looking
smilingly about as though his whole mind were
on the scenes of gambling before him.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Darrin's eyes caught
sight of Dan Dalzell, as that young officer bowed
the Countess Ripoli to a seat.</p>

<p>In vain did the Countess use her prettiest
smiles to hold Danny Grin by her side as she
played. Dalzell had been schooled at Annapolis
and in the Navy itself, and knew how to take his
leave gracefully, which he did, followed by the
pouts of the Countess. As soon as she saw that
the ensign's back was turned, a very unpleasant
frown crossed her beautiful face.</p>

<p>Dave continued his stroll until he met Dan at
a point where none stood near them.</p>

<p>"Keep on smiling, Dan," urged Dave, in an
undertone. "Don't let that grin leave your
face. But it's back to the ship for us on the
double-quick! I may be dreaming, but I think
I have found out the meaning of Mr. Green Hat's
strange activities. I believe there is a plot on
foot to bring England and our country into war
with each other. One thing is certain. It's my
duty to get back on board as fast as possible.
I must tell the admiral what I have overheard."</p>

<p>Dan did not forget the injunction to keep on
smiling. He proved so excellent an actor that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he laughed heartily as Dave Darrin finished his
few but thrilling words.</p>

<p>"Tiresome here, isn't it?" murmured Dan,
aloud. "We might as well go back on board
ship."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE ADMIRAL UNLOADS HIS MIND</h3>


<p>Reporting their coming aboard to the
officer of the deck, Dave and Dan hastened
to their respective quarters.</p>

<p>While Ensign Dalzell performed a "lightning
change" from "cits" to uniform, Dave first
seated himself at his desk, where he wrote a note
hurriedly.</p>

<p>This done, he passed the word for an orderly,
who promptly appeared.</p>

<p>"Take this note to the Captain," ordered
Darrin.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said the messenger.</p>

<p>Dave then hastened to make the necessary
change in his own apparel. So quickly did he
act, that he had his uniform on and was buttoning
his blouse when the messenger returned.</p>

<p>"The Captain will see Ensigns Darrin and
Dalzell immediately," reported the orderly.</p>

<p>Returning the orderly's salute, Dave buckled
on his sword belt, hung on his sword, drew on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
white gloves, and started. He found his chum
ready.</p>

<p>Together the young officers reported at the
Captain's quarters. Captain Allen was already
seated at his desk.</p>

<p>"Orderly!" called the commanding officer
briskly.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>"Guard the door and report that I am engaged."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>In an instant Captain Allen, who had briefly
greeted his youngest officers, turned to them.</p>

<p>"Your note, Mr. Darrin, stated that you had a
matter to report to me of such importance that
you did not believe I would wish to lose a moment
in hearing what Mr. Dalzell and yourself could
tell me."</p>

<p>"That is the case, sir," Dave bowed. "Have
I your permission to proceed, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You may take seats, if you wish."</p>

<p>Bowing their thanks, the young officers remained
on their feet.</p>

<p>Ensign Dave plunged at once into the narration
of what had befallen them ashore.</p>

<p>Captain Allen listened to the tale without comment,
but when Dave related what he had overheard
the two men say when passing the imitation
grove on the darkest part of the Casino veranda,
the commanding officer sprang to his feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin," he demanded, "are you positive
of the words that you have just repeated?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir. In a matter of such importance I
was careful to record every word in my mind just
as it was uttered."</p>

<p>"Then I must communicate with the Admiral
at once," continued Captain Allen, seating himself
again. "Even if the Admiral be abed I consider
this a subject of enough importance to call
him."</p>

<p>Taking down the receiver of the telephone that
led direct to the fleet commander's quarters, the
Captain sent in a call to the Admiral's quarters.</p>

<p>Soon there came a response.</p>

<p>"This is the Captain speaking, Admiral," announced
the "Hudson's" commanding officer.
"Although the hour is late, sir, I request permission
to report to you on a matter of importance."</p>

<p>"I will see you, Captain, in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I request permission to bring
two officers with me."</p>

<p>"Permission is granted, Captain."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Hanging up the transmitter, Captain Allen
sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else, gentlemen, that you
wish to say to me before we go to the Admiral?"</p>

<p>"I think I have told you all, sir," Dave replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I, too," Dalzell added.</p>

<p>Keeping his eye on the clock, Captain Allen
presently arose, girded on his sword, parted the
curtains, and led the way.</p>

<p>"If I am wanted, Orderly, I shall be in the
Admiral's quarters."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>The three officers then filed rapidly along the
deck, presented themselves at the Admiral's
quarters, and were admitted.</p>

<p>Admiral Timworth was standing at the rear of
his cabin when the subordinate officers entered.
He came quickly forward, instructed his orderly
to guard the door, then turned to his visitors.</p>

<p>"I believe it will be best, with your permission,
sir," began Captain Allen, "to let Mr. Darrin
make his report to you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin will proceed, then."</p>

<p>So Dave repeated the story he had told the
Captain. Admiral Timworth listened until the
recital had been finished, and then asked several
questions.</p>

<p>"It does not sound like a hoax," commented
Admiral Timworth, at last. "Yet it is impossible
for me to conceive how two British battleships
are to be sunk near Malta, or near anywhere else,
and Americans blamed for the act. Captain
Allen, can you imagine any way in which such a
thing might be effected?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot, sir."</p>

<p>"The subject must be given careful thought,"
declared the Admiral. "By the way, Mr. Darrin,
do you think you could identify those two men
who talked of the proposed destruction of the
British battleships?"</p>

<p>"I am positive that I could do so, sir," Dave
rejoined, "provided they were not disguised."</p>

<p>"Then you may meet them again, as we shall
stop at various Mediterranean ports. If you do,
sir, I wish you to report to me anything that you
may find out about them. Mr. Dalzell did not
see them, did he?"</p>

<p>"I may have passed them, sir," Dan replied,
"but I would not know them, if meeting them, as
the men whom Mr. Darrin mentions."</p>

<p>"Then, Captain, you will see to it," directed
the Admiral, "that Mr. Dalzell has shore leave
whenever Mr. Darrin does. The two young men
will go ashore together so that Mr. Darrin, if
opportunity presents, may indicate the plotters to
Mr. Dalzell."</p>

<p>The Captain and the young officers bowed their
understanding of this order.</p>

<p>"The presence of Gortchky here, taken with
what Mr. Darrin overheard those men talking
about, and coupled with what took place on the
mole at Gibraltar, leads me to believe that some
foreign government has plans for involving the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
United States government in serious complications,"
resumed the Admiral, after a pause.
"Gortchky is not in charge of any very extensive
plot. He is simply a tool of greater minds, and
it may easily be that the pair whom Mr. Darrin
overheard are those who are directing Gortchky in
some really big and dangerous scheme. By the
way, gentlemen, was either of you introduced to
any young or charming woman ashore?"</p>

<p>"We were both presented to the Countess
Ripoli, sir," Darrin answered, at once.</p>

<p>"And at the Countess's request, I took a little
turn with her on one of the verandas, sir," Dan
added.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about the Countess and your
meeting with her, Mr. Dalzell," Admiral Timworth
directed.</p>

<p>So Dan plunged at once into a narration of his
chat with the Countess, to which Admiral Timworth
listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Ripoli?" he mused aloud, at last. "I do not
recall the name as that of a supposed secret service
agent. Ripoli? Let me see."</p>

<p>From a drawer of his desk the Admiral drew
out an indexed book. He turned over, presumably,
to the letter "R," then scanned the
writing on several pages.</p>

<p>"She has not been reported to me as a suspected
secret service agent of any country," said the fleet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
commander, aloud. "Yet she may very likely
be a spy in the service of some ring of international
trouble-makers. I will enter her name
now, though I cannot place anything positive
against it."</p>

<p>"If either of us should meet the Countess
Ripoli again, sir," queried Dan, "have you any
orders, sir, in that event?"</p>

<p>"If you do meet her," replied the admiral, "do
not be too distant with her, and do not let her see
that she is in any sense under suspicion. Just
treat her as you would any charming woman
whom you might meet socially. However, should
you meet her again, you may report the fact to
me. I shall doubtless have some further instructions
for you, gentlemen, but that is all for the
present. Captain, you will remain."</p>

<p>Formally saluting their superiors, Dave and Dan
withdrew and returned to Dave's quarters. For
half an hour Dan remained chatting with Dave,
then went to his own quarters.</p>

<p>By daylight the "Hudson" was under way
again, bound for Naples. Dan and Dave were
called to stand their watches, and life on the
battleship went on as usual.</p>

<p>It was but an hour after daylight when Admiral
Timworth, who had remained up the rest of the
night with Flag Lieutenant Simpson, sent a long
message to the Navy Department at Washington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The message crackled out over the "Hudson's"
wireless aerials, and was soon afterward received
in Washington at the huge naval wireless station
there.</p>

<p>"Good night, Simpson," said the Admiral,
when his flag lieutenant reported that the message
was in the hands of the wireless operator.</p>

<p>"Shall I leave any instructions for your being
called, sir?" asked Lieutenant Simpson.</p>

<p>"Have me called at ten o'clock, unless a reply
from the Navy Department should arrive earlier.
In that case have me called at once."</p>

<p>The flag lieutenant is the personal aide of the
fleet commander.</p>

<p>If the Admiral received an interesting reply
from the Navy Department during the voyage to
Naples, he at least concealed the fact from Ensigns
Darrin and Dalzell. Ensigns, however, are
quite accustomed to reserve on the part of
admirals.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock one sunny afternoon when the
"Hudson" entered the Bay of Naples. Her
anchorage having already been assigned by wireless
by the port authorities at Naples, the "Hudson"
came to anchor close to the "Kennebec"
and "Lowell" of the Mediterranean Fleet. Admiral
Timworth now had three war vessels under
his own eyes.</p>

<p>At four bells (two o'clock) an orderly called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at Dan's and Dave's quarters, with orders to
report to the Admiral at once.</p>

<p>When the two young ensigns reached the Admiral's
quarters they found Lieutenant Simpson
there also.</p>

<p>"Be seated, gentlemen," directed the Admiral.</p>

<p>For a few moments Admiral Timworth shuffled
papers on his desk, glancing briefly at some of
them.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said the Admiral, wheeling
about in his chair and looking impressively at
Darrin and Dalzell, "it seems to me I had better
preface my remarks by giving you some idea of
the Fleet's unusual and special mission in the
Mediterranean. That may lead you to a better
comprehension of why a certain foreign power
should wish to create, between Great Britain and
the United States, a situation that would probably
call for war between the two greatest nations
of the world."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>ON LIVELY SPECIAL DUTY</h3>


<p>"In the first place," resumed the Admiral,
"you must know that relations between
Great Britain and the United States are, and
for some time have been, of an especially cordial
nature. Throughout the great war Great Britain
has been compelled to buy a large part of her food
and munitions in the United States. Except for
her being able to do so she would have been
forced out of the war and the Entente Allies would
have been defeated. There are Englishmen who
will make you feel that the saving force of the
United States is greatly appreciated in England,
just as there are other Englishmen who will remark
stupidly that the United States as a seller,
has had a great opportunity to grow rich at
England's expense.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that thinking Englishmen
are prepared to go to almost any extent to
cultivate and keep the friendship of the United
States, just as duller-witted Englishmen declare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that the United States depends upon England for
existence.</p>

<p>"During the present war Great Britain has
felt compelled to impose certain blockade restrictions
upon our commerce with neutral powers
in Europe. This has hampered our commerce to
some extent, and there are many in the United
States who feel deep resentment, and favor taking
any steps necessary to compel England to abandon
her interference with our merchant marine. Some
Englishmen take an almost insolent attitude in
the matter, while others beg us to believe that
England hinders some of our commerce only in
order to preserve her own national life. In other
words, if she did not carefully regulate the world's
trade with, for instance, Denmark and Holland,
those countries would sell much of their importations
to Germany, whereby the duration of
the war would be prolonged by reason of help
obtained by Germany in that manner.</p>

<p>"As you can readily understand, the situation
is full of delicate points, and many sensibilities
are wounded. There have been times when only
a spark was needed to kindle a serious blaze of
mutual wrath between Great Britain and the
United States. And you may be sure there are
some governments in this world that would be
delighted to see feelings of deep hostility engendered
between Britons and Americans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"At present, however, there seems to be not
the slightest cloud over the relations between
Great Britain and our country.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Darrin, you have obtained clues to
a startling plot that has for its object the causing
of distrust between the two greatest nations. If
one or more British warships should be sunk, by
some means that we do not at present know, and
if the blame could be plausibly laid against Americans,
there would be hot-tempered talk in England
and a lot of indignant retort from our country.
It would seem preposterous that any Englishman
could suspect the American government of destroying
British warships, and just as absurd to
think that Americans could take such a charge
seriously. Yet in the relations between nations
the absurd thing often does happen. Should
England lose any warships it would seem that
only Germany or Austria could be blamed, yet it
might be possible for plotters to manage the thing
so successfully, and with so much cleverness, that
the United States would really seem to be proven
to be the guilty party. Our duty as officers of the
Navy can be performed only by frustrating the
hideous plot altogether.</p>

<p>"So, Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell, while we are
at Naples you will spend as much of your time as
possible on shore. You will go about everywhere,
as though to see the sights of the city and as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
bent on getting your fill of pleasure. Unless under
pressing need you will not be extravagant in your
expenditures, but will conduct yourselves as
though sight-seeing within the limits of your
modest pay as ensigns. You will, however, not
be put to any expense in the matter, as all your
expenditures will be returned to you out of an
emergency fund in my hands.</p>

<p>"Your object in going ashore will be to report if
you see Gortchky in Naples. I feel rather certain
that the fellow is already there. You, Mr. Darrin,
will also keep your eyes wide open for a sight of
either or both of that pair whom you overheard
talking at Monte Carlo. You will also note and
report if you find the Countess Ripoli in Naples."</p>

<p>"And if we meet her and if she speaks to us,
sir?" asked Dalzell. "What if she even wishes
to entertain us, or to claim our escort?"</p>

<p>"Do whatever you can to please the Countess,"
replied the Admiral, promptly. "Be agreeable to
her in any way that does not interfere with
other and more important duties to which I have
assigned you."</p>

<p>Judging by a sign from the fleet commander
that the interview was now at an end, Dave and
Dan rose, standing at attention.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have given you a wrong impression
in one particular," Admiral Timworth continued.
"I do not wish you to understand, gentlemen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that I have intimated that any power, or any
combination of powers, has directly ordered any
act that would lead to the sinking of British
warships. Governments, even the worst, do not act
in that way. The thing which the power I have
in mind may have done is to give certain secret
agents a free hand to bring about war between
England and the United States. Undoubtedly,
the secret agents at the bottom of this conspiracy
have been left free to choose their own methods.
Thus the foreign government interested in this
conspiracy could feel that it did not <i>order</i> the commission
of a crime, no matter what might happen
as the result. Now, gentlemen, have you any
questions to ask?"</p>

<p>"None, sir," Dave Darrin responded immediately.</p>

<p>"None, sir," echoed Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Then you may go," rejoined Admiral Timworth,
rising and returning the parting salutes of
the young officers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was presently noised about among the ship's
company that Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell had
been ordered ashore on special duty.</p>

<p>"How did you work it?" Lieutenant Barnes irritably
demanded of Danny Grin.</p>

<p>"Why? Do you want to work a trick yourself?"
asked Dalzell, unsympathetically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"No such luck for me," growled Barnes.
"While in port I am ordered to take charge of
shifting stores below decks."</p>

<p>"Fine!" approved Dan.</p>

<p>"And I wish I had you for junior officer on that
detail," growled Barnes.</p>

<p>"If I get tired of staying ashore," Danny Grin
proposed genially, "I'll make humble petition to
be assigned as junior on your detail."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>M. DALNY PLANS A TRAGEDY</h3>


<p>"Say, I wonder if these people call this a square
deal," muttered Danny Grin, as he surveyed
the dish that the waiter had just left for him.
"I called for ham and eggs and potatoes, and the
fellow has brought me chicken and this dish of
vegetables that none but a native could name."</p>

<p>"Call the waiter back and ask him to explain
his mistake," Ensign Darrin suggested, smilingly.</p>

<p>"I can't talk their lingo," returned Dalzell
plaintively.</p>

<p>"Nor can I speak much of it, either," admitted
Dave.</p>

<p>"Can you speak any Italian?"</p>

<p>"Only a little, and very badly at that."</p>

<p>"Where did you learn Italian?" demanded
Danny Grin.</p>

<p>"From an Italian-American cook on board our
ship," Darrin explained.</p>

<p>"Whew! You must have done that while I
was asleep," Dalzell complained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know enough Italian to carry me very
far," laughed Darrin. "Perhaps between two
and three hundred useful words, and some of the
parts of a few verbs. Let me see just what you
thought you were ordering."</p>

<p>Dan held out a somewhat soiled bill of fare on
which the names of the dishes were printed in
Italian and English.</p>

<p>"I tried to pronounce the Italian words right,"
Dan went on, with a grimace.</p>

<p>"Let me hear you read the words over again,"
Dave begged.</p>

<p>Dan did so, his comrade's smile deepening.</p>

<p>"Dan," said Dave dryly, "you speak Italian
as though it were French. Italian is too delicate
a language for that treatment."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do about this chicken?"
Danny Grin persisted.</p>

<p>"Eat it," suggested Darrin, "and use some of
your time ashore in getting closer to the Italian
language."</p>

<p>Dave was served with just what he had ordered
for a pleasing meal&mdash;an omelet, spaghetti and
Neapolitan tomatoes, with dessert to follow.</p>

<p>"I'm no great admirer of chicken, and I did
want ham," sighed Dan, as he glanced enviously
at his chum's dainty food. Nevertheless Ensign
Dalzell ate his meal with an air of resignation that
greatly amused Dave Darrin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The restaurant was one of the largest and
handsomest to be found along that great thoroughfare
of Naples, the Riviera di Chiaja. The place
would seat perhaps four hundred guests. At this
hour of the day there were about half that number
of persons present, many of whom were Americans.</p>

<p>The chums had succeeded in obtaining a small
table by themselves, close to an open window
that overlooked the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Watching the throngs that passed, both on foot
and in carriages of many types, the young naval
officers felt certain that at no other point could
they obtain as good a general view of the city of
Naples. Many well-to-do Italians were afoot,
having sold their carriages and automobiles in
order to buy the war bonds of their country. As
there were several Italian warships in port, sailors
from these craft were ashore and mingling with
the throng. Soldiers home on sick leave from the
Austrian frontier were to be seen. Other men,
who looked like mere lads, wore new army uniforms
proudly. These latter were the present
year's recruits, lately called to the colors and
drilling for the work that lay ahead of them, work
in deadly earnest against hated Austria.</p>

<p>All that went on before the caf&eacute; was interesting
enough. It was not, however, until near the
end of the meal that anything happened of personal
interest to Dave and Dan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was a quick step behind them, next
a voice cried gaily:</p>

<p>"My dear Monsieur Darrin, who could have
expected to see you here?"</p>

<p>"Any one who knew that my ship is in the
harbor might have expected to see me here,"
replied Dave, rising and smiling. "How do you
do, Monsieur le Comte?"</p>

<p>It was indeed the Count of Surigny, and that
dapper, well-set-up young Frenchman was nattily
dressed, smiling, and with an unmistakable air
of prosperity about him.</p>

<p>Dan had also risen. Then as the three seated
themselves Dave inquired what refreshment his
friend of Monte Carlo would allow them the
pleasure of ordering for him. The Count asked
only for a cup of coffee, after which the chat went
merrily on.</p>

<p>"My dear Darrin, I rejoice to be able to tell
you that I have determined never again to visit
Monte Carlo," said the Count. "Moreover,
I am prosperous and happy. Ah, what a debt of
gratitude I owe you! I know you must be wondering
why I am not serving my country in the
trenches."</p>

<p>"I knew you must have some good reason for
not serving in the French army at such a time,"
Dave replied.</p>

<p>"I tried to enter the army," Surigny replied,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"but the surgeons refused to pass me. One of
my eyes is too weak, and there is, besides, some
little irregularity in the action of my heart that
would make it impossible for me to endure the
hardships of a soldier. So, despite my protests
and entreaties, the surgeons have refused to accept
me for military service."</p>

<p>"Is it permitted to ask if you have found employment?"
Dave inquired.</p>

<p>"I have found employment of a sort," the Count
rattled on, without a shade of embarrassment.
"It might be questioned if I am worth the remuneration
which I receive, but at least I am
happy. I am permitted to serve a friend in some
little matters of a personal nature."</p>

<p>That answer was enough to prevent Dave from
making any further inquiries as to the Count's
new means of a livelihood.</p>

<p>"It gives me the greatest happiness to be able
to see you again, and to hear your voice," continued
the Count. "I am here in Naples only
as a matter of accident, and it may be that my
stay here will be short. I was at a table in the
rear with a friend when I espied you sitting here.
Is it permitted that I bring my friend over and
present him?"</p>

<p>"We shall be delighted to meet any friend of
yours, Surigny," Dave replied pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Then I shall bring him here at once," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the Frenchman, lightly, rising and moving rapidly
away.</p>

<p>"I wonder what line of work the Count can be
in now," mused Dalzell, aloud. "It would appear
to be something that pays him very well and
allows him to travel. I wonder if the friend he
is to introduce to us is the one that employs him."</p>

<p>"We shall know that if Count Surigny chooses
to inform us," smiled Dave.</p>

<p>Then their talk ceased, for they heard the
Count's voice in conversation with some one as
he came up behind them.</p>

<p>"My dear Monsieur Darrin," cried the Count,
"I am honored in being able to present to you
Monsieur Dalny."</p>

<p>Ensign Darrin rose, wheeled and thrust out
his hand. Then his eyes turned to the newcomer's
face.</p>

<p>Nor could the young naval officer repress a
slight start, for M. Dalny was unmistakably one
of the two men whom he had overheard on the
veranda of the Casino at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darrin," replied M. Dalny, accepting
Dave's hand, "I feel that I am indeed
honored in being able to meet one who, I understand,
has been such a friend to my friend the
Count of Surigny. I shall hope to see much of
you."</p>

<p>Dalny was then introduced to Dalzell, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which, at Dave's invitation, the newcomers
seated themselves. Fresh coffee was ordered.</p>

<p>But Dave Darrin's head was now in a good deal
of a whirl.</p>

<p>As to the identity of M. Dalny, there could be
no mistake whatever. And here was the Count
of Surigny, evidently in the friendship of this
plotter against the American Navy. It was not
unlikely that the Count, too, was in the employ
of this enemy of the United States.</p>

<p>"What can this whole thing mean, and does
Surigny <i>know</i> that he is working against the peace
and honor of my country?" Dave asked himself,
his pulses throbbing.</p>

<p>"Are you to be here long at Naples, Monsieur
Darrin?" Dalny soon asked in his most velvet-like
tones.</p>

<p>"I really haven't the least idea, Monsieur
Dalny," Dave replied truthfully, forcing a smile.
"I am not deep in the confidence of Admiral
Timworth."</p>

<p>"I thought it very likely," purred Monsieur
Dalny, "that you might have heard from your
officers as to how many days of shore liberty are
likely to be granted your sailors."</p>

<p>"Oh, probably we shall&mdash;" began Dan, who
found the French conversation easy to understand
in this instance.</p>

<p>But the slightest of signs from Darrin was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sufficient to check Dalzell's intended statement.
So Danny Grin merely finished:</p>

<p>"Probably we shall hear soon how long our stay
here is to be."</p>

<p>"Are you interested, Monsieur Dalny, in the
length of our stay here?" queried Ensign Dave,
gazing carelessly into the eyes of the stranger.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is but a matter of idle curiosity to me,"
replied the other, shrugging his shoulders amiably.
"Just as you understand it would be a matter of
a little curiosity, my dear Monsieur Darrin, to
know whether the American fleet now in the harbor
here will keep together for the next few weeks,
and what ports you will visit. But I imagine
that you have, as yet, no information on such
points."</p>

<p>Dave did not reply to M. Dalny's remarks, who,
however, did not appear to notice the omission.
Drawing forth a long cigar and lighting it, Dalny
puffed away, seeming to prefer, after that, to
listen to the conversation of the others.</p>

<p>"Who can this Monsieur Dalny be?" Dave
asked himself, racking his brain. "And of what
nationality? The word 'Monsieur' is French in
itself, though Dalny is hardly a French name.
Perhaps it makes little difference, though, for
men who sell their time and services as I am
afraid this Dalny fellow is doing, are quite likely
to masquerade under assumed names."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently M. Dalny excused himself for a few
moments. Sauntering toward the rear of the
restaurant, he stepped into a side passage, then
made a quick entrance into a private room, the
door of which he instantly locked. He now
crossed the room and stood before the solitary
diner in that room.</p>

<p>"My dear Mender!" cried Dalny.</p>

<p>"Your face betrays interest, Dalny," remarked
the other, who was the older of the pair whom
Dave had heard on the Casino veranda.</p>

<p>"And I am interested," continued Dalny, in a
low tone. "I have met the two young officers
from the American flagship."</p>

<p>"That is what you are here to do," smiled
Monsieur Mender.</p>

<p>"The fellow Darrin refuses me any information
about the movements of the American fleet."</p>

<p>"That was perhaps to be expected," answered
Mender reflectively.</p>

<p>"But I fear matters are worse than that,"
Dalny went on hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, Dalny."</p>

<p>"Darrin did not see my face until he rose to
greet me, when Surigny introduced us," continued
Dalny. "Then he started, slightly, yet
most plainly. Monsieur Mender, that young
American naval officer knows something about us."</p>

<p>"Not very likely, Dalny."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then he at least suspects something."</p>

<p>"Why should he?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Mender," hurried on Dalny, "you
recall that evening on the Casino veranda at Monte
Carlo? You and I, as we approached a little
grove of potted trees, talked rather more incautiously
than we should have done."</p>

<p>"It was an indiscretion, true," nodded the
white-haired Mender thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And, afterwards, as you know, I told you I
thought I heard someone move behind those
little trees."</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I suspect, Monsieur Mender, that it was
Ensign Darrin, of the battleship 'Hudson,' who
stood behind those trees, and who overheard us."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew if such were the case," replied
M. Mender huskily, his face paling with anxiety.</p>

<p>"If Darrin overheard our talk, he doubtless reported
it to his superior officers," declared Dalny.</p>

<p>"Unquestionably&mdash;if he really heard," admitted
Mender.</p>

<p>"Then that pair of young officers, for they
are close friends, must have been sent ashore to
see if they could get track of the numerous party
whom you direct, my dear Monsieur Mender."</p>

<p>"You believe that the two young American
officers are ashore in Naples as spies upon us?"
questioned Mender, his tone cold and deadly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would seem so," Dalny answered readily.</p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;" began Mender, slowly, then
paused.</p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;what?" demanded Dalny,
after waiting a few moments while his chief
reflected.</p>

<p>"It would mean that the Italian authorities,
as soon as informed of what is suspected against
us, would send out their keenest men to locate
us, and then we should be arrested."</p>

<p>"What could be done to us?" queried Dalny.</p>

<p>"In these war days not very much evidence is
required against men who are accused of being
spies, my excellent Dalny. We might or we
might not be accorded a trial, but one thing is
quite sure; we would be shot to death on the
charge of being spies."</p>

<p>As he pronounced these significant words
Mender shrugged his shoulders. His manner was
cool, one would have said almost unconcerned.</p>

<p>"You are right," agreed the younger plotter.
"The Italians, like all the other peoples engaged
in this war, hate spies bitterly, and would be quick
to mete out death to us."</p>

<p>"It would be desirable," Mender proceeded,
"to prevent the young officers from going back
aboard their ship."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Dalny, bluntly.</p>

<p>Mender laughed, cold-bloodedly, in a low tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"In Naples," he explained, "there are, as you
know, my dear Dalny, hundreds of bravos, some
of whom are the most desperate fellows in the
world&mdash;men who would stick at nothing to earn
a few <i>lira</i>. And they will ask no awkward
questions as to which country they serve in aiding
us."</p>

<p>"Then you would have Darrin and Dalzell
seized, by night, by some of these bravos, and
carried away to a secure place where they could
be confined until your plans have been carried
through?" inquired Dalny, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It is always dangerous to have banditti
seize men and hide them away, especially in a
country that is engaged in war," replied Mender,
slowly. "Now, if, in one of the narrow, dark
streets of Old Naples, these young Americans
were settled by a few quiet thrusts with the
blade, their bodies might then be dropped into a
sewer. The bodies might not be found for weeks.
On the other hand, captives, no matter how
securely hidden, may find means to escape, and
all our care in the matter would go for naught.
Besides, these Sicilian bravos of Naples much
prefer to settle a man with one or two quick
thrusts with a narrow blade, and then&mdash;But
what is the matter, Dalny? Does the use of the
knife terrify you?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Dalny, huskily. "I was merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thinking that, if a man like either Darrin or Dalzell
escaped from a knife, after seeing its flash,
and if he suspected me of being behind the attempt,
either young man would be likely to lay
hold of me and snap my spine."</p>

<p>"If you are fearful of the chances and of the
possible consequences, Dalny," replied Mender
coldly, "you may withdraw."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" protested Dalny quickly. "You
are my chief, Monsieur Mender, and whatever
you wish I shall do."</p>

<p>Mender puffed for a few moments at a Russian
cigarette, before he again spoke.</p>

<p>"Dalny," he said, "you may be sure I do not
distrust either your loyalty or your courage.
Go back to your Americans. Detain them as
long as needful at the table, no matter by what
arts. Within twenty minutes I shall have a
leader of Neapolitan bravos here, and I shall
have a plan to unfold to him. Then he will go
and post his men. You will receive instructions
from me that you cannot mistake. You are
right in fearing Darrin and Dalzell. We can
afford to take no chances. That pair of young
American officers shall have no chance of reporting
our presence in Naples to their superior
officers. Sooner than permit the least risk of
interference with our plans I shall remove them
from our way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Darrin and Dalzell are to be killed, then?"
asked Dalny hoarsely.</p>

<p>"They shall be snuffed out," replied Mender,
flicking the ash from his cigarette. "Go, Dalny,
and do your part as far as you have heard it from
me. I will attend to the rest. Do not be uneasy."</p>

<p>Dalny made a low bow before his cold-blooded
chief, then left the private room, returning to
Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell, whose death, under
the knives of cowardly treachery, he must do his
best to help bring about!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>TREACHERY HAS THE FLOOR</h3>


<p>"You will not have much time for sight-seeing,
I am afraid," Count Surigny was
saying, as Monsieur Dalny soft-footedly
returned to the table.</p>

<p>"I do not know how much time we shall have,"
Dave answered.</p>

<p>"If you have but little time, then it will be
most unfortunate," spoke Dalny softly, with
his engaging smile. "Naples is vastly rich in
things that are worth while seeing."</p>

<p>"We are not likely to have the time to see many
of them," Darrin answered.</p>

<p>"That is most unfortunate," replied the Count,
in a regretful tone.</p>

<p>"Yet there is a way to partly overcome that
misfortune," suggested Mr. Dalny.</p>

<p>"How, Monsieur?" inquired Darrin, turning
his gaze on the face of the international plotter.</p>

<p>"Why, secure a good guide, engage a carriage
drawn by good horses, and then move from point
to point as fast as possible," replied Dalny. "I
know Naples well. Perhaps I can offer my services
for, say, this evening."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are the public places of interest likely to be
open in the evening?" questioned Dave.</p>

<p>"Not the museums," admitted M. Dalny.
"But there are many other things to be seen.
Naples has several beautiful parks. Some of
them contain notable statues. These parks are
the nightly resort of all classes of the Italian
community, who are always worth observing.
Then, too, there are many curious glimpses to
be had of the night life of the underworld of
Naples. In a word, Monsieur Darrin, there are
enough night sights, of one kind and another, to
fill profitably a month in Naples. And, as I
know the city, you may command me. I will be
your guide. Shall we go to-night?"</p>

<p>"Where could we go, with the most advantage
in the matter of sight-seeing?" Dave
asked.</p>

<p>"Out toward Vomero," suggested young Count
Surigny.</p>

<p>"Too fashionable, and very dull," replied Dalny,
with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"Then where?" asked Dan.</p>

<p>But Dalny's reply was lost to him, for at that
moment Darrin, holding a rolled napkin at one
side of the table, and below the level of the table
top, waved it slowly back and forth. Dan was
the only one of the party at the table who could
see the moving napkin. By this simple wig-wag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
signal device Dave Darrin sent to his chum the
silent message:</p>

<p>"Dalny is one of the plotters I overheard on
the Casino veranda. Think he suspects us.
Follow my lead."</p>

<p>The instant that the message ended Dan glanced
slowly around him, then upward at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Soon Dalny's interest in the table talk waned
for outside on the sidewalk he caught sight of a
young Neapolitan dandy, standing on the curb,
his back turned to the restaurant as he swung a
jaunty little cane. The motions of that cane
spelled out a message that only Dalny, of all
the party at the table, could read. And that
message read:</p>

<p>"Get carriage, take Americans for drive at
dark. Finally, direct driver to turn into the
Strada di Mara. Leave carriage with Americans
when urged by shop-keeper."</p>

<p>That was the whole message. It was plain
enough, however, to instruct Dalny as fully as
he needed to be directed. The scoundrel, as he
watched the swinging movements of the cane,
looked out into the street between half-closed
eyelids, slowly puffing out rings of smoke from
his long cigar.</p>

<p>"We are becoming dull, good friends," laughed
Dalny presently, glancing at the others. "Suppose
we order more coffee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more for me, thank you," protested Dave.</p>

<p>"But you have had hardly any coffee,"
Dalny declared.</p>

<p>"I am ready to admit that I can't keep up
with the average American in drinking coffee,"
Dave replied.</p>

<p>"But you will have more, my dear Dalzell,"
urged Dalny.</p>

<p>Dan, who was inwardly agitated over the
information he had received secretly from his
chum, looked at Dalny almost with a start. In
Dan's soul there was loathing for this foreigner
with the engaging smile.</p>

<p>"I do not believe I can stand any more coffee,"
confessed Dan.</p>

<p>"So you and I, Surigny, must drink all the
coffee at this table," said Dalny, with a shrug
of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I can drink a little more," replied the Count.</p>

<p>The day was now rapidly waning, bringing
on a balminess of evening such as is found in
few places other than Naples. The streets were
becoming crowded with pedestrians.</p>

<p>"Waiter," called Dalny, "you will be good
enough to secure for us a carriage with good
horses. Get it as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>But the waiter, perceiving a signal from Dalny,
knew that the carriage must not arrive too soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dave scanned the bill that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had been presented for the meal, then laid a
banknote on the bill. The waiter, returning,
attended to the paying of the bill and received
his "tip" from the change that he brought back.</p>

<p>The party lingered at the table to wait for the
arrival of the carriage that was intended to
convey Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell to their
death.</p>

<p>"My dear Count," said Dalny presently, "I
regret much that the appointment which you
told me you had for this evening will prevent
you from going with us. Can you not manage
to break the appointment without doing injustice
to others?"</p>

<p>Taking his cue from the manner in which the
question was put, the Comte of Surigny replied:</p>

<p>"It would delight me beyond measure to be
one of the party to-night, but it is impossible.
My appointment cannot be set aside."</p>

<p>The restaurant was brilliantly lighted, and the
street lights had begun to flash out as the carriage
arrived.</p>

<p>"Now, for a night of real sight-seeing!" cried
Dalny, rising eagerly. "My dear Americans, I
promise you something such as you have never
before experienced!"</p>

<p>"I am heartily sorry that you are prevented
from going with us, Surigny," declared Dave,
holding out his hand to the young Frenchman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall pray for better fortune next time,"
smiled the Count, rather sadly.</p>

<p>"We are all desolate that you cannot go with
us, Surigny," declared Dalny, also holding out
his hand. Dan, too, shook hands with Surigny.
Then the international plotter led the two Americans
to the carriage awaiting outside.</p>

<p>After the Count of Surigny had waved his
hand to the party and had walked away, Dalny
placed Dave and Dan on the rear seat of the
barouche, while he himself sat facing them.</p>

<p>A few words in Italian from Dalny, and the
horses started. For half an hour the driver took
his fares past ordinary sights.</p>

<p>"But we are not much interested, driver,"
cried Dalny, turning at last to the man who held
the lines. "We are bored with this dullness,
when Naples holds so much that may be seen by
night. Take us through the Strada di Mara."</p>

<p>So the driver headed his horses toward the
eastern, or older, part of the city. The Strada
di Mara leads through one of the most thickly
populated sections of Naples, and a part of the
street extends up a steep hillside.</p>

<p>"You see how poor the people are here," said
Dalny, as the horses slowed down to a walk. "We
shall come soon, however, to a more interesting
part of the street. Crime lurks here, also; not
the more desperate crimes though. The Strada<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
di Mara, in one part, is the resort of thieves who
wish to dispose of their petty plunder by turning
it into cash. And, as strange merchandise is
dealt in here, the shops offer a variety of wares.
We will presently look into one or two of the
shops."</p>

<p>"What on earth can Dalny be driving at?"
wondered young Ensign Darrin. "Can he think
that we would enter such shops, and buy the
plunder that thieves have sold there?"</p>

<p>At the next street corner an Italian lad with a
sweet voice began to sing. Danny Grin noticed
that most of the people in this steep, narrow alley,
that was by courtesy called a street, were now
going indoors. Only a man here and there remained
outside.</p>

<p>"That's curious," thought Dan to himself.
"Don't these people like music, that a street
singer should drive them inside?"</p>

<p>When the carriage had passed on to the next
block a man came out of a shop and waved his
hand to the driver, who promptly reined in his
horses.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," urged the shop-keeper, in English,
"be kind enough to step inside and look at
some of the bargains I am offering."</p>

<p>Dave, who understood, whispered to Dalny:</p>

<p>"It can hardly be worth while to get out and
look at what is probably stolen goods."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the contrary," rejoined Dalny, "this man
is likely to show us some things that will help
me in explaining the interesting points of Naples
to you. Come!"</p>

<p>Opening the door of the carriage, the international
plotter stepped out, leading the way.
Of course Dave and Dan followed him.</p>

<p>It now turned out that the Italian's shop was
some doors farther up along this block. As he
led the way, and Dalny and the Americans followed,
neither young officer observed that the
driver had turned his horses around and was
driving away.</p>

<p>At the same time, the few men now on the
sidewalk of this block started to close in on the
little party.</p>

<p>Tragedy was stepping across the threshold!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>HEMMED IN BY THE BRAVOS</h3>


<p>Suddenly out of a doorway lurched a big
Sicilian, seemingly intoxicated.</p>

<p>He lurched against Dave, then drew
back, scowling fiercely at the young ensign.</p>

<p>"Your mistake, sir," spoke Darrin, purposely
using English.</p>

<p>Dave would have passed, but now the fellow
placed himself squarely in Darrin's way.</p>

<p>"You have struck me!" snarled the Sicilian in
his own language. "Why?"</p>

<p>Then, uttering a peculiar cry, the man, with
a movement of wonderful swiftness, drew a
knife. In the dim light that blade flashed like
subdued fire.</p>

<p>"One, two, three&mdash;out!" gritted Dave Darrin,
leaping forward.</p>

<p>Striking up the fellow's arm, Dave caught at
the knife-wrist. He twisted it savagely and the
weapon clattered to the rough pavement.</p>

<p>Bump! Dave struck the fellow hard between
the eyes, sending him to earth, where he lay
still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan, now keenly alert, discovered that the
pretended shop-keeper had also drawn a knife.</p>

<p>"To quarters!" yelled Danny Grin.</p>

<p>"Back to back!" shouted Dave, placing his
shoulders close to his chum's. "Dan, we must
fight for our lives. The lives of all these cattle are
not worth a scratch on our bodies! Down 'em!"</p>

<p>"We'll make ten-pins of 'em," hissed Dalzell.</p>

<p>And Monsieur Dalny? That honorable gentleman
was now scuttling down the street to safety.</p>

<p>The fight that followed was a mixture of boxing,
football tactics and sheer Yankee grit that Dave
and Dan now employed as they faced more than
half a dozen scoundrels armed with the long,
thin knives of the bravos of Naples.</p>

<p>Bump! Ensign Darrin struck up the arm of the
first scoundrel to reach for him. In a twinkling
Dave had broken that rascal's right wrist, forcing
the fellow to drop his weapon.</p>

<p>Like a flash Dave caught his victim up, holding
him overhead and sending the bravo, heels
first, into the face of another scoundrel. The
man, struck by this human missile, went to
earth dazed, and with a broken jaw to boot.</p>

<p>Dalzell, too, was proving the stuff that was in
him. Dodging a descending hand that held a
knife, then landing a smashing blow over the
fellow's heart, Dan sent him to earth. At that
instant a knife would have gone through Danny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Grin's ribs had not Dalzell let one of his feet fly
with such speed and skill as to break another
bravo's shin-bone.</p>

<p>Crouching low, Dave received still another
assailant. Seizing him below the knees, then
rising, he hurled the ruffian over backward on
his head, the fall nearly snapping the owner's
spine at the neck and leaving him unconscious.</p>

<p>Two more men were quickly downed, and seemed
inclined to stay there. The young ensigns had
not received a scratch so far, which was due as
much to luck as to their own skill.</p>

<p>Now a wail of terror rose on the air. Two of
the bravos took fairly to their heels. The rest
wavered, then gave way, glaring with sullen
looks at these young Americans who could fight
so terribly without weapons.</p>

<p>"Come on!" urged Dave, in a low voice. "Let's
get out of here! There is no credit in staying
here and taking on more fighting. Let's hurry
while the hurrying is good."</p>

<p>Only one of the bravos was ahead of them as
the young naval officers began their sprint. That
fellow was trying to get out of harm's way, but
hearing pursuit at his heels, the frightened fellow
halted suddenly, wheeled and struck out with
his knife at Ensign Darrin.</p>

<p>Dave dodged, then landed both fists against
the ruffian's ribs, knocking the fellow clean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
through a window with a great crashing of
glass.</p>

<p>"Hustle!" muttered Dalzell, as he halted to
wait for his chum. "There may be a hundred more
of these fellows who can be called out on a single
block."</p>

<p>But there was no pursuit. The bravos had had
enough. Afterwards it was a matter of local
report that two of the rascals handled by Darrin
and Dalzell all but died of their injuries. The
Strada di Mara contained no bravos reckless
enough to follow these incredible Americans on
this wild night of trouble.</p>

<p>Still sprinting, Dave, with Dan at his heels,
overhauled a running figure. Dave shot out
his right hand, gathering in, by the coat collar,
Monsieur Dalny.</p>

<p>"My friend," uttered Dave grimly, as he halted
the fugitive, "this does not appear to be one of
your best fighting nights."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" stammered M. Dalny, his face
white. "I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you said before," Dave retorted dryly.
"Let it go at that."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to charge that I ran away?"
demanded Dalny, with a show of injured dignity.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," retorted Dave, ironically. "You
were merely trying to show two scared Americans
the shortest way back to a safe part of Naples."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not safe here," whispered Dalny, trembling.
"We are almost certain to be followed by an
enraged mob. Let us use discretion."</p>

<p>The word "discretion" recalled Darrin to the
fact that he must not be too rough with the
fellow through whom he hoped to learn something
of great interest to Admiral Timworth.</p>

<p>"You are right, Monsieur Dalny," agreed the
young ensign. "Let us waste little time in getting
away from this part of Naples."</p>

<p>No walk could have been too brisk, just then,
for Dalny. He was not a coward in all things,
but he felt a deadly terror of cold steel.</p>

<p>In addition, this international plotter had, just
then, a lively conviction that friends of the men
whom these American officers had handled so
roughly might, if they overtook him, feel a decided
thirst for vengeance upon the man who
had led such giants against the bravos of the
Strada di Mara.</p>

<p>"Why are you looking back so often?" Dave
asked, as the three gained the next corner.</p>

<p>"To see if we are pursued," confessed Dalny.</p>

<p>"That is prudent," Darrin smiled, "yet hardly
necessary."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the international
plotter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/illus-126.jpg" width="262" height="400" alt="&quot;Dave shot out his right hand.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Dave shot out his right hand.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Because," explained Dan, grinning, "the
only bravos who have any reason to be afraid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of us to-night are those who might get in front
of us. Those who keep behind us will have
every chance to get away unharmed."</p>

<p>"You are a droll pair," muttered Dalny.</p>

<p>"And, unless I am greatly in error, my fine
fellow, you led us into that trap for the purpose
of having something bad happen <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original text omits this word">to</ins> us," muttered
Dave, but he kept the words behind his teeth,
for he did not care, as yet, to come to an open
quarrel with this fellow.</p>

<p>Before long the three reached one of the broader,
well-lighted thoroughfares. Here they engaged
a driver and carriage, and were soon once more
in the Riviera di Chiaja.</p>

<p>As they passed one of the larger buildings,
Mender, looking down upon the avenue through
the blinds of a window of a room at the hotel,
saw the three as they drove past an arc light.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter with that simpleton
Dalny?" muttered the arch-plotter. "Did he,
at the last moment, fail in the courage necessary
to lead the Americans into the trap that I had
baited for them?"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Dalny, closeted with his
chief, was relating to that astounded leader the
story of what had happened in the Strada di
Mara.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," muttered Mender.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p><p>"No more can I," rejoined Dalny. "The
Americans are demons when it comes to
fighting."</p>

<p>"At some point, my good Dalny, you must
have bungled the affair."</p>

<p>"Why not say that the fault must have been
with your choice of bravos?" jeered the subordinate.
"Why did you pick out alleged bravos
who would allow themselves to be put to flight
by unarmed men?"</p>

<p>"I must wait until I have a fuller report of
this night's misadventure," declared Mender.
"I dare say that, within a few hours, I shall have
more exact information."</p>

<p>In this belief Mender was quite right. Before
daylight he was visited by the leader of the
bravos of the Strada di Mara, who announced
that he must be paid two thousand <i>lira</i> (about
four hundred dollars) as extra money to be divided
among his outraged followers.</p>

<p>In the case that this extra money was not forthcoming,
declared the leader of the bravos, Mender
and his friends might find Naples much too dangerous
a city for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>EVIL EYES ON SAILORMAN RUNKLE</h3>


<p>In the center of a huge room in the Hotel dell'
Orso, overlooking the Chiaja, Dave Darrin
and Dalzell came to a halt.</p>

<p>Below they had just left Dalny in the carriage,
and had come straight up to their room,
which they had engaged when first they came
ashore.</p>

<p>They had not, as one might suspect, overlooked
the opportunity of finding whither Dalny drove
after leaving them. For a short, broad-shouldered
young man, Able Seaman Runkle, U. S. S. "Hudson,"
had been on the lookout for them on the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Runkle, by special order of Captain Allen,
U. S. N., was not in uniform, but in civilian
attire. In another carriage Able Seaman Runkle,
at Dave's order, followed the conveyance that
took Dalny back to the appointed meeting
place with Mender. The sailorman's carriage
did not, of course, stop when Dalny's vehicle
did, but kept slowly on.</p>

<p>"Shadowing" is often a two-edged tool. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Runkle returned to his post he, in turn, was followed
by the same dandy who had done the cane
signaling late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That fellow Dalny is almost too bad medicine
for me to swallow," Dan muttered with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>"Of course he is a liar and a villain," Dave
returned seriously. "But when a man is wanted
to do the foulest kind of work, I suppose it must
be rather hard to find a gentleman to volunteer.
Probably Dalny's employers feel that they are
fortunate enough in being able to obtain the
services of a fellow who <i>looks</i> like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"He led us into that trap to have us assassinated,"
Dan declared hotly.</p>

<p>"Or else to have us so badly cut up that we
would feel, in the future, more like minding our
own business," suggested Ensign Dave with a
smile.</p>

<p>"We got out of it all right that time," Dan went
on bluntly, "but I don't want any more such
experiences. The next time we might not have
luck quite so much on our side."</p>

<p>"What puzzles me," Dave continued, wrinkling
his brows, "is why Dalny or any of his crowd
should want us stabbed."</p>

<p>"They wanted us killed," Dan insisted.
"Nothing short of killing us would have satisfied
those bravos if they had succeeded in getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
us at their mercy. Yet why should our death be
desired?"</p>

<p>"For only one reason," Dave answered, the
truth coming to him in a flash. "Dalny is here
in Naples, for which reason his white-haired
fellow-plotter is probably here, too. We were
sent ashore to find out if they are here. When
Dalny shook hands with us this afternoon he
perceived that I recognized him as one whose
remarks I undoubtedly had overheard at Monte
Carlo. He then concluded that I had been sent
ashore to find out if he were here. He knew, or
suspected, that I would report my information
to the Admiral. Hence the determination to
kill me, and, since you are with me, to kill you
also. Our bodies would have been hidden, and
the Admiral would have been able only to guess
why we did not return to the ship. Dan, what
hurts me most is the practical certainty that the
Count of Surigny is now with that band of international
cut-throats. I had hope for a nobler
future for the Count, and also I am disappointed
to find him working for my enemies. He must
hate me fearfully because I thwarted his one-time
purpose to commit suicide!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed the Count could be
so bad," Dan mused. "Yet the proof appears
to be against him."</p>

<p>"Why, of course he's one of their band," Dave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
continued. "It's a fearful thing to say, but it
is plain that I saved only an ingrate and a rogue
from the crime of suicide. However, Dan, we
are losing time. I must begin my report to Captain
Allen."</p>

<p>At that instant there came a slight scratching
sound at the door. Tiptoeing to the door, Dalzell
opened it far enough to admit Seaman Runkle,
who, as soon as the door had been closed and
locked, promptly saluted both young officers.</p>

<p>"What is your report, Runkle?" Dave demanded.</p>

<p>"Your party in the carriage, sir, dismissed the
rig at this address," reported the sailorman,
handing Ensign Darrin a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"You did well," Dave answered. "Find a
seat, Runkle, until I have written a note which
you are to take aboard to Captain Allen."</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes the letter was completed.
It was not a long document, but gave,
in brief form, a summary of the adventures and
discoveries of the two ensigns since coming
ashore.</p>

<p>"You will take this aboard, Runkle," Dave
directed, "and you will see that it reaches Captain
Allen, even though he has turned in and
has to be awakened. You will tell the officer
of the deck, with my compliments, that such
orders were given me by Captain Allen. Now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Runkle, don't let anything interfere with your
speedy return to the ship. Also remember that
you may be followed, and that Naples is a bad
town in which to be trailed at night."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of the bad people of Naples,
sir," rejoined the sailorman, with a quiet smile.
"Do you expect me to return to you, sir?"</p>

<p>"That will be as Captain Allen directs."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Good night, sir."</p>

<p>Able Seaman Runkle was shown out by Ensign
Dalzell, who locked the door of the room after
the departing sailorman.</p>

<p>In the meantime a spy who had followed
Runkle back to the Hotel dell' Orso had telephoned,
in a foreign language little understood
in Naples, the information concerning that
sailorman's reporting to his officers, and had
added the suggestion that very likely the sailor
would be sent out to the fleet with a written
report.</p>

<p>"I think it highly probable that the sailor
<i>will</i> be sent with a written report," agreed
Mender, at the other end of the telephone
wire.</p>

<p>"And if the sailor does try to get out to the
fleet?" insinuated the spy.</p>

<p>"If the man leaves the hotel to go to the
water front," commanded Mender, in a voice
ringing with energy and passion, "see to it that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
he is laid low and that the letter is taken
from him. At any cost I must have turned over
to me any written report that Ensign Darrin
tries to send to his commanding officer. Nor
am I through with Darrin himself!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>ORDERS CHANGE IN A MINUTE</h3>


<p>"Hullo! What does that fellow want?"</p>

<p>Able seaman Runkle was within a block
of the mole where the "Hudson's" launch
was due to cast off at half-past ten o'clock, but he
halted in his tracks.</p>

<p>From a doorway, a little nearer to the mole, a
head was thrust out slightly as its owner surveyed
the sailorman.</p>

<p>Then the man stepped out of the doorway to
the sidewalk. He was a big fellow, with something
of the slouch and swagger that are to be observed
in the tough the world over.</p>

<p>Now this stranger stood quite still, sharply
regarding the pausing sailorman.</p>

<p>"If there are less than six of that breed ahead
of me," muttered Runkle, staring ahead once
more, "then it doesn't make any real difference."</p>

<p>Two more men slipped out of dark recesses
further on, while, an instant later, Runkle became
aware that two men, who had not been visible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a few moments before, were now closing up behind
him.</p>

<p>"I wonder what these chaps think they're
going to do," mused Runkle, his sailor heart
quaking not at all, though he scented fight in the
air. "Hullo!"</p>

<p>Now a sixth man stepped out from a doorway
just at his side. With a lusty push this sixth
man sent Runkle out into the street.</p>

<p>"Where are your manners, my man?" demanded
Seaman Runkle, returning to the sidewalk.
"And what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>Suddenly the muzzle of a revolver gleamed in
Runkle's face, but the sailor did not betray any
sign of fright.</p>

<p>"Put that down!" ordered Runkle sharply, at
the same time making a gesture to indicate his
command.</p>

<p>A reply was volubly given in Italian, of which
Runkle understood not a word.</p>

<p>In the few seconds that this was happening the
five other swarthy men began to close in on the
sailor. Runkle lost no time in discovering that fact.</p>

<p>A gesture from the man with the pistol showed
that he expected Runkle to hold up his hands.</p>

<p>"You'd rather see my mitts aloft, eh?" asked
the sailor, in a mocking voice. "All right, then!"</p>

<p>Up went the sailor's hands, as high as he could
raise them. A gleam of satisfaction shone in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
eyes behind the revolver, but that look instantly
changed to one of pain.</p>

<p>For Runkle, while holding his hands high,
also raised one of his feet. That foot went up
swiftly, and high enough to land against the lower
edge of the bravo's pistol wrist. In a jiffy the
wrist was broken and the pistol came clattering
to the pavement.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," offered Runkle, snatching up
the weapon. Then he raised his voice to yell:</p>

<p>"If there are shipmates within hail let 'em hurry
here to keep Jack Runkle from killing a few
rattlesnakes!"</p>

<p>Just in time to escape the points of two knives,
Seaman Runkle backed against a stucco wall,
thrusting out the revolver and his able left fist.</p>

<p>The first two men who leaped at him went
down under the impact of that fist. A third received
a scalp wound from the butt of the revolver.
Any court would have exonerated the sailorman
for killing his assailants, but Dave's messenger
was much too good-natured to kill while there
was another path to safety.</p>

<p>That kindliness undid Runkle's defense. As a
man rushed him on each side a third bravo dropped
low in front of him and seized the seaman's legs,
upsetting him.</p>

<p>"Foul tackle, with a dozen to one!" growled
Runkle, as he felt himself going down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he laid about, freeing his feet and using
them while he plied his left fist and struck out
with the revolver. Even now he did not want to
press the trigger of the weapon, which was soon
snatched away from him.</p>

<p>With hoarse cries, several of the bravos now
held the sailor so that he could barely squirm.</p>

<p>Swiftly moving fingers roamed rapidly through
his pockets. Then one of the cowardly assailants
snatched out of one of Runkle's pockets a letter,
muttering a few words to his companions.</p>

<p>Striking a match the thief glanced at the address
on the envelope. Even if he knew no English
he could discern that the envelope was addressed
to Captain Allen of the "Hudson."</p>

<p>With another quick word the thief vanished
through a doorway. Up from the enraged sailor
leaped those who had been holding him down.</p>

<p>"Sheer off there! Belay! belay!" growled
several hoarse voices. Rushing up, cat-footed,
came a dozen or more fresh-faced, husky young
jackies from the fleet.</p>

<p>"Come on, mates! The maccaroni-eaters are
sneaking away!" yelled the foremost of the
rescue party, that had come from the mole in
answer to Runkle's call.</p>

<p>Only two of the Italians were slow enough to
be overtaken and manhandled by the jackies.
The rest of the assailants vanished swiftly into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
near-by houses, the doors to which were instantly
closed and bolted.</p>

<p>For perhaps twenty seconds the two captured
bravos were badly used. Then, thoroughly cowed,
they were allowed to slip away.</p>

<p>"What happened to you, shipmate?" demanded
one of the rescuers.</p>

<p>"Enough!" growled Runkle. "They got my
money."</p>

<p>"Much?"</p>

<p>"All I had."</p>

<p>"Tough luck," declared one of the sailors.</p>

<p>"The chap who has your money surely got
away before we could reach him."</p>

<p>"I've got to get aboard the flagship as soon as
I can," exclaimed Able Seaman Runkle ruefully.</p>

<p>"The launch leaves in ten minutes, mate,"
volunteered another. "Those of us who are going
aboard will now do well to get back to the mole."</p>

<p>So Jack Runkle departed with his rescuers,
but his eyes flashed the vengeance he would take
should he meet his despoiler again.</p>

<p>On the way out to the flagship Runkle sat silent
and out of the run of talk that was going on around
him.</p>

<p>Going up over the side of the "Hudson," Runkle
reported himself on board, and then added to the
officer of the watch, Lieutenant Totten:</p>

<p>"I've a message for the Captain, sir, and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
orders to report to him immediately on coming
aboard."</p>

<p>"Orders from an officer of this ship?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll send an orderly to see if the Captain is
still awake," replied Lieutenant Totten.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," Runkle persisted,
"but I have orders to say that Captain Allen, by
his own request, is to be called, if necessary, sir,
in order to hear my message."</p>

<p>"Very good," nodded Lieutenant Totten, and
turned to an orderly, sending him to Captain
Allen's quarters.</p>

<p>"The Captain will see Seaman Runkle at once,"
the orderly reported a few moments later.</p>

<p>Saluting Lieutenant Totten, Runkle turned and
hastily presented himself before the door of the
Captain's quarters.</p>

<p>"You have something to report, Runkle?"
questioned Captain Allen, seating himself at his
desk.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Ensign Darrin gave me a letter to
bring to you, sir. It may interest you, sir, to
know that on my way back to the ship I was attacked
near the mole by a mob of cut-throats.
One of them held me up with a revolver, but I
got it away from him. Then they all attacked me,
and soon had me down, sir. One of the rascals
took all my money and a letter addressed to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Took Ensign Darrin's letter away from you?"
demanded Captain Allen, looking, as he felt, a
good deal disturbed.</p>

<p>"No, sir; not Ensign Darrin's letter, sir," replied
Able Seaman Runkle, with just a shadow of
a grin. "It was a letter addressed to you, but
I have reason to believe, sir, that Ensign Darrin's
letter is still safe. If you'll permit me, sir, I'll
look for the ensign's letter where I placed it, after
leaving the ensign and before quitting the hotel."</p>

<p>Captain Allen at once nodded his permission.
Runkle partly undressed, then explored the place
where he had concealed Dave's letter.</p>

<p>"What was the other letter addressed to me
that was taken away from you, Runkle?" questioned
the captain, while the search was going
on.</p>

<p>"It wasn't really a letter, sir," the sailorman
replied, this time with a very broad grin. "It
was just an envelope addressed to you, and filled
with blank paper."</p>

<p>"Who addressed that envelope?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because I thought that Ensign Darrin's letter
might be important, and I had an idea that some
skulking sneaks might try to take it away from
me."</p>

<p>Then Runkle, having put his clothing in order,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
stepped towards Captain Allen, holding out an
envelope.</p>

<p>"I think, sir, you'll find that this is Ensign
Darrin's letter, and that it's just as he gave it to
me, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Allen hastily broke the seal, took out
the enclosure, and read rapidly, a frown gathering
on his face all the while.</p>

<p>"Runkle," cried the Captain, springing up and
placing a hand on the sailorman's shoulder,
"did Ensign Darrin suggest to you the ruse that
fooled your assailants?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You did it on your own initiative?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did it out of my own head, sir, if that
means the same thing," replied the puzzled sailor
slowly.</p>

<p>"It does mean the same thing," continued
Captain Allen, "and, Runkle, I'm proud of you.
That's a good headpiece you have on your
shoulders, and I shall make note of it on
your record. You have shown good judgment.
You have a head fitted to meet difficulties.
You may look for promotion in the near
future."</p>

<p>"Have I your permission, sir, to ask if that
was Ensign Darrin's letter and if it was in good
order?" asked Runkle.</p>

<p>"It was, my man, thanks to your intelligent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and courageous performance of duty. Runkle,
how much money did the bravos take from
you?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen dollars in real money, sir, and
about two dollars in <i>lira</i> money."</p>

<p>Sailors sometimes call the Italian money "lira
money," because the lire, which is worth about
the same as the French <i>franc</i>, or twenty cents, is
the common unit of Italian currency. "Lira"
is the plural of "lire."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you don't like the Italian money
very well, Runkle," smiled Captain Allen.</p>

<p>"I don't, sir, and I don't like the people of this
country any better. Not after the beating I got
to-night."</p>

<p>"That wasn't the fault of the Italian people,
Runkle," declared the Captain. "Toughs in
New York would use you at least as badly as did
the bravos ashore to-night. The Italian people
themselves are very friendly to us, and the government
does all in its power to show its friendship
for our country. If I were to send ashore complaint
of your being attacked to-night the police
would dragnet the city in an effort to find the men
who attacked you, and, if found, it would go hard
with them. But for reasons that I cannot explain
to you, no complaint will be made. I do
not wish the Italian police to know what took
place to-night. As to the money that you lost,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
I will have you make affidavit before the paymaster,
to-morrow, and will see that the money
is repaid to you. Runkle, you may tell your
mates anything you like about the fight, but do
not mention the fact to any one, that you bore
with you and were searched by bravos for a letter
from Ensign Darrin."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"That is all, Runkle. You may go, but remember
that I have you in mind as a man of
good and quick judgment, and as one who has
the courage to carry his duty through in the face
of any obstacles."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Saluting, the sailorman left the Captain's
quarters. A minute later Captain Allen sent
an orderly to the Admiral. Three minutes later
Admiral Timworth received the commanding officer
of the flagship.</p>

<p>Quickly Captain Allen placed Dave's letter in
his superior officer's hands.</p>

<p>"This is live news, indeed," cried the Admiral,
as he laid the letter down. "Darrin and Dalzell
are doing clever work."</p>

<p>"But their work is suspected, sir, as the letter
shows. Moreover, the fellow spies of Gortchky
and Dalny are shadowing our two young officers
ashore, for the messenger who brought this letter
was attacked by bravos. Our messenger was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
robbed of his money and of a faked letter with
which the sailor had provided himself."</p>

<p>Captain Allen then repeated Runkle's story.</p>

<p>"You have Runkle slated for promotion, of
course?" asked Admiral Timworth.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"A man like Runkle, if he keeps to his present
promise, should go as high in the Navy as it is
possible for an enlisted man to go," declared the
Admiral. "But, Captain, the organization and
desperation of our country's enemies worry me.
It is plain that some very desperate scheme is
afoot for making trouble between England and
our country. That would drag us in against all
of the Entente Allies if the success of the plot
should involve us in war with England at this
time. The proposed sinking of a British warship
is the inkling we have had, but the real scheme
may be something else. The first clue of all that
we had, even before Darrin and Dalzell came
aboard at Gibraltar, came from the American
Embassy at Paris. Our Ambassador, under orders
from Washington, has our secret service at
work there, which keeps our government directly
in touch with many of the doings of international
plotters. It seems to me highly important that
Ensign Darrin should be detached long enough
from this ship to be sent to Paris, where he should
repeat to our Ambassador all that he knows, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
give close descriptions of the spies with whom he
has come in contact. Having made his report,
Darrin can return to the ship at Genoa, which will
be our next port of call in these waters."</p>

<p>"Would you send Mr. Darrin alone, sir?"
asked Captain Allen. "He might be trailed and
again attacked. Would it not be far better for
Ensign Dalzell to go with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and perhaps it may be as well for Runkle
to go, too, as their orderly," replied the Admiral,
after a moment's hesitation. "There is a train
leaving for Paris at four in the morning. Where is
Lieutenant Totten?"</p>

<p>"He will be off watch in an hour, sir."</p>

<p>"Let Lieutenant Totten go ashore to carry my
written instructions to Ensign Darrin. I will enclose
the necessary funds in an envelope with my
instructions. Totten, on his return to the ship,
will be able to assure me that the communication
reached Ensign Darrin safely, and that Darrin,
after reading my instructions, which will be brief,
tore up and burned my letter."</p>

<p>"Shall I send Runkle ashore in uniform or in
citizen's dress?" asked Captain Allen.</p>

<p>"In citizen's clothes, as before," replied Admiral
Timworth. "I will call my flag lieutenant.
Kindly see that the paymaster is sent to me,
Captain."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the Admiral's letter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
instruction had been signed, and a substantial
amount of money enclosed.</p>

<p>On coming off deck duty at eight bells, midnight,
Lieutenant Totten was instructed to order a launch
alongside. Then, with the bulky envelope in an
inner pocket, and accompanied by Seaman Runkle,
Totten went over the side.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the launch delivered them
at the mole, then glided out into the bay.</p>

<p>"I hope we shan't run into a gang of hoodlums
again," said the sailorman respectfully.</p>

<p>"I have my revolver with me," smiled the
lieutenant. "The Italian police would feel grateful
if I sank its six bullets into six bravos of
Naples."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>DAN HAS VERY "COLD FEET"</h3>


<p>Rap-tap!</p>

<p>That sound brought Dave Darrin out of
a sound sleep. Dan slumbered on.</p>

<p>"Who's there at this hour of the night?" asked
Dave, through the door, in the best Italian he
could muster.</p>

<p>"From the 'Hudson,'" came the answer, in a
voice so low that Dave did not recognize it.</p>

<p>"One minute, then."</p>

<p>Dave slipped back, shaking his chum to rouse
him, then drew the curtains around Dalzell's bed.</p>

<p>In record time Dave drew on his own shirt,
slipped into trousers, put on collar, cuffs and tie,
and followed this with coat and vest.</p>

<p>Then he stepped to the door, opening it. Repressing
his natural cry of astonishment, Dave
silently admitted his visitors, next closed and
locked the door.</p>

<p>"Orders from the Admiral," said Lieutenant
Totten, in an undertone, and passed over the
envelope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Stepping under the light which he had hastily
turned on, Darrin read his orders.</p>

<p>"Read this, Dan," said Dave, passing the letter
of instructions to his chum, who was now also
fully dressed. "Then I will read it once more,
after which we will burn it."</p>

<p>"Suits me," commented Dan, when he had
finished and was passing back the letter. "I've
always wanted to see Paris."</p>

<p>"You won't see much of it this time," smiled
Ensign Dave. "This is business, and nothing
else."</p>

<p>Then Dave tore the letter into strips. Taking
these to the open fireplace he set fire to them.
All three officers watched until the letter had been
completely burned.</p>

<p>"And now," Dave continued, "I will mix this
charred paper thoroughly with the ashes that,
fortunately, are left in the grate."</p>

<p>When he had finished, the mixing had been
done so well that they would be keen eyes, indeed,
that could note the presence of minute particles
of burned paper in the grate's contents. His
next act was to telephone the hotel clerk to send
up a time-table.</p>

<p>"We have plenty of time, yet," smiled Darrin,
glancing at his watch, after he had finished consulting
the time-table. "It won't be the height
of comfort to travel to Paris without baggage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
However, when we get there we can buy anything
that we may need."</p>

<p>"It will be great to shop in Paris," cried Dan,
his eyes gleaming.</p>

<p>"Don't get the idea that we are going to do any
running about in Paris," Dave warned his chum.</p>

<p>"Not even if we have some idle time there?"</p>

<p>"Not even then," Dave answered. "I am very
sure that neither the Admiral nor the Ambassador
would wish us to show ourselves much at the
French capital. We might thereby attract the
attention of spies."</p>

<p>"That is true," agreed Lieutenant Totten.</p>

<p>Business being now attended to, Dave and Dan
had time to finish dressing comfortably. Then
followed a period of waiting. Later the hotel
clerk was asked to summon an automobile. In
this the Paris-bound party, including Runkle,
left the hotel, Totten accompanying them.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had the American party
left the hotel than an Italian, crouching in the
shadow of a building further along on the same
block, whispered to his companion:</p>

<p>"Telephone Signor Dalny for instructions."</p>

<p>Within three minutes a second automobile
rolled up to the hotel.</p>

<p>"To the railway station first, on the chance of
finding the Americans there," the spy called to
the driver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave's party did not have long to wait at the
station. Totten remained with them to the last,
however, that he might be able to report a safe
start to the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Don't look, sir, but coming up behind you, I
am certain, is a fellow I saw on the street outside
the hotel just before we started," reported
Seaman Runkle.</p>

<p>"Then we are being trailed," Dave said.</p>

<p>Not until the time came for starting did Lieutenant
Totten shake hands hurriedly with his
brother officers and leave them, though he still
stood near the train.</p>

<p>Dave and Dan sprang into their compartment
in one of the cars, Able Seaman Runkle following
more slowly.</p>

<p>"There's that spy fellow getting on the running-board
further down the train, sir," whispered
Runkle.</p>

<p>"I expected him," answered Dave dryly.</p>

<p>"Would you like to lose him, sir?"</p>

<p>"Off the train altogether, do you mean,
Runkle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Can you put him off without hurting him?"</p>

<p>"I think I can get him off, sir, without even
scraping one of his knuckles."</p>

<p>"You're at liberty to try, Runkle, if you are
sure you won't injure the man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>As the guard came along, locking the doors,
Runkle leaped down to the ground.</p>

<p>"Help, Mr. Totten, help!" called the seaman
in a low voice that none the less reached the ears
of the departing lieutenant.</p>

<p>Then Runkle moved directly up to the spy
leering into his face and making insulting signs
that caused the fellow to flush red.</p>

<p>"You're no good&mdash;savvy?" insisted Runkle
in a low tone, making more faces and gestures.</p>

<p>So quickly was it done that the now thoroughly
insulted spy, though he did not understand English,
leaped at Runkle in a rage.</p>

<p>"He's going to try to rob me, sir!" cried
Runkle, not very effectively dodging the blows
that the fellow aimed at him.</p>

<p>"Here, what are you up to?" demanded Totten,
also in English, as he reached out to grab the spy's
collar.</p>

<p>In that strong grip the spy writhed, but could
not escape.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," cried Runkle, with an unmistakable
wink, after which he raced for the car
and the compartment in which the two young
ensigns waited.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Totten is holding on to the chap,
sir," announced Runkle gleefully. "He won't
let him go until the train's out, either."</p>

<p>Holding the unlocked door open a crack, Dan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Dalzell watched as the train pulled away from the
station.</p>

<p>"Totten has him, and is explaining to a policeman,"
Dalzell chuckled. "That spy doesn't
travel with us this trip."</p>

<p>"What's the odds?" asked Darrin, after a pause.
"Dalny must belong to a big and clever organization.
He can wire ahead to spies who will board
the train later on and follow us into Paris."</p>

<p>"Then, with your leave, sir, I'll keep my eye
open for spies until we're back aboard the flagship,"
suggested Runkle.</p>

<p>"Very good, so long as you break neither laws
nor bones, Runkle," Dave laughed.</p>

<p>The Americans had the compartment to themselves.
Had all been in uniform Runkle would
not have been likely to travel in the same compartment
with the young officers, but in citizen's
dress much of discipline could be waived for
greater safety.</p>

<p>Though Dan Dalzell did not now have much
hope of sight-seeing in Paris, he was able, after
dozing until daylight, to gaze interestedly out
upon the country through which he was traveling.</p>

<p>Able Seaman Runkle was another absorbed
window-gazer. As for Ensign Dave Darrin, while
he caught many interesting glimpses of the scenery,
his mind was mainly on the question of how the
international plotters were planning to break the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
friendship between the two strongest nations
on earth.</p>

<p>By what means could these plotters sink a
British ship, and yet make it appear to be the work
of Americans?</p>

<p>Hundreds of miles had been traveled, and one
day had swung far on into another before a
plausible answer came to Darrin's mind.</p>

<p>Then Dave fairly jumped&mdash;the thing that Admiral
Timworth so dreaded now looked quite easy.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Dan, staring at
his chum.</p>

<p>"Why?" countered Dave.</p>

<p>"You jumped so hard," Dan replied.</p>

<p>"I was thinking."</p>

<p>"Stop it!" advised Danny Grin. "A little
harder thinking than that might wreck the train."</p>

<p>Dalzell enjoyed every hour of the journey. In
the daylight hours he was busy "taking in" all
the country through which the train passed. In
the evening hours, Dan was outside on the platform,
at every station, to watch the crowds, large
or small.</p>

<p>As for Seaman Runkle, that splendid lad was
absorbed, almost to the point of gloom, in watching
at every station for a sign of a spy on the
train with them.</p>

<p>Before they reached the French-Italian frontier
Dave realized, with a start, that Admiral Timworth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had failed to provide them with such
credentials as would probably be called for in
crossing the Italian-French frontier, and that they
had forgotten to ask for such papers. However,
at the frontier stop their friend Dandelli, the
Italian naval officer, in uniform, almost ran into
them. He was glad to vouch for the pair to the
French and Italian guards at that point, and,
after some hesitation, Dave and Dan were allowed
to proceed into France.</p>

<p>"But be careful to have proper papers when returning,
if you come this way," Dandelli smilingly
warned them.</p>

<p>It was seven o'clock on the second morning
after leaving Naples when the express reached
Paris.</p>

<p>Hardly had the train stopped when Darrin and
Dalzell were out and moving through the station.
Seaman Runkle kept at a distance behind them,
his sharp eyes searching for any signs of spies.
But Runkle was able to make no report of success
when he stepped into the taxicab in which his
superior officers sat.</p>

<p>Danny Grin was again busy with his eyes as
the taxicab darted through the beautiful streets
of the French capital.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" Dave asked
suddenly, noting that Dan's grin was even wider
than usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Paris strikes me that way&mdash;that's all I can
tell you," drawled Dan.</p>

<p>"Do you consider Paris a joke?" demanded
Darrin.</p>

<p>"Of course not. But Paris has the name of
being such a gay town&mdash;in peace times, of course.
But at this early hour the city looks actually
gray to me. If the look of the city doesn't improve,
later in the day, I can't understand how
any one can feel like being gay."</p>

<p>"Paris and the world have managed well
enough, in the past, to combine for gayety,"
Dave replied. "Just now, of course, with all
the men thinking of war, and so many women
wearing black for dear ones they've lost at the
front, the city can't show much of its former
gayety. Paris is going through her ordeal of
fire. These are dark days for good old France!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Dan's face fell grave.</p>

<p>"Now, what's the matter?" quizzed Darrin.</p>

<p>"I've just had a horrible thought," Dan confessed.
"You haven't been concealing from me,
have you, the fact that, though you had no frontier
passport you have a letter or some form of
credentials to the American Ambassador?"</p>

<p>"I haven't anything of the sort," Dave rejoined,
he, too, now looking grave.</p>

<p>"A fine lay-out this is, then," growled Danny
Grin. "Here we are, going to the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Ambassador on a matter of the utmost delicacy.
We are going to tell him and ask him some of the
secrets of the United States government, and we
haven't a scrap of paper to introduce us. Do
you realize what we'll get? The Johnny-run-quick!
We'll get the balluster slide, the ice-pitcher
greeting! Dave, we're going to land hard
on the sidewalk right in front of the Embassy.
And then some frog-eating, Johnny Crapaud
policeman will gather us in as disorderly persons!
Fine!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY</h3>


<p>As the taxicab dashed around a corner
Dave raised his cap.</p>

<p>"Well, this must be our destination,"
he announced. "I've just saluted Old Glory as
it flutters over the building."</p>

<p>The taxicab came to a stop before a handsome
building.</p>

<p>On each side of the posts of the gateway stood
a brass shield on which was the inscription:</p>

<p>"Embassy of the United States of America."</p>

<p>Very gravely Dan and Runkle followed Dave,
each raising his hat to the Flag as soon as his feet
touched the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"There's a carriage entrance below," said
Dave, "but we'll take the plain way and walk
in."</p>

<p>Paying and dismissing the taxicab driver,
Dave led the way to the entrance.</p>

<p>"A naval party to see the Ambassador, at his
convenience, on business," Dave announced to
the attendant at the door.</p>

<p>They were shown to an anteroom near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
door, where they were soon joined by a Mr.
Lupton, who introduced himself as Second Secretary
to the Embassy.</p>

<p>"The ambassador, Mr. Caine, will not be
here before nine o'clock," announced Mr. Lupton.
"I know that you are expected. You have
not breakfasted?"</p>

<p>"No," Dave confessed.</p>

<p>"Then I will ask you to let me be host. Before
I lead the way I will ring for some one to see that
your sailorman is well taken care of."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Darrin and Dalzell were
seated at a small breakfast table with Mr.
Lupton.</p>

<p>"Just before reaching here," began Dave, "it
occurred to Mr. Dalzell and myself that we
have, beyond our card-cases, no means of identification.
Can you tell us how Mr. Caine will be
sure that he is talking with the right persons?"</p>

<p>"I believe that will be arranged all right,"
smiled Mr. Lupton. "I, too, have taken you
gentlemen on trust, but presently, I believe, we
are going to be satisfied."</p>

<p>Two minutes later there stalked into the room
a tall, handsome young man whose navy uniform
set off his good figure to great advantage.</p>

<p>"Jetson?" exclaimed Dave, rising.</p>

<p>"The same," smiled the newcomer, advancing
and holding out his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>He and Dave shook hands heartily, after which
Dan came in for a similar greeting.</p>

<p>Readers of the Annapolis series will recall
Jetson as being a fellow member of the Brigade
of Midshipmen with Darrin and Dalzell at the
U. S. Naval Academy. At one time, there,
Dave and Jetson had not been good friends, but
Dave had, at the very great risk of his own life,
saved Jetson from drowning. Now, the two young
officers were on excellent terms.</p>

<p>"I understand, now, what was darkness to
me before," murmured Dave, after Jetson had
seated himself at table. "Admiral Timworth
knew that you were here, Jetson, and able to
identify us."</p>

<p>"I have been here for three months," explained
Jetson, smiling, "doing some work to assist the
naval attach&eacute; of this Embassy, Commander
Tupper. I have had three months of the hardest
work in this old capital, but now, confound it,
my work here has ended and I'm ordered to join
my ship. The bridge and the quarter-deck are
places of boredom to a fellow who has seen what
I've seen here. Why, I've even made two trips
up to the front&mdash;one of them to Verdun."</p>

<p>"Lucky dog!" cried Danny Grin, with feeling.
"So you've seen some of the big fighting!"</p>

<p>"It may be well to state that I know fully the
business on which you are ordered here," Jetson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
continued, "so you may mention it freely before
me if you are so inclined."</p>

<p>"Then can you tell me," Dave asked, "if it is
known how our enemies propose to sink a British
warship and make it appear to be the work of
someone in the American Navy?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," Jetson replied. "In fact, it was
only on receipt of a wireless from near Monte
Carlo that the Ambassador had any knowledge
that the international plotters intended to attempt
the destruction of a British warship as
a means for creating bad feeling between the two
countries. The whole plot seems foolishly improbable
to me."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem so to me, any longer," rejoined
Dave.</p>

<p>"Then you must know some thing that I
haven't heard about," murmured Jetson curiously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin," broke in Mr. Lupton, "I will
be the Ambassador's authority for you to speak
as freely of the matter as you choose."</p>

<p>Dave and Dan thereupon told all that had
befallen them at Monte Carlo and at Naples.</p>

<p>"But still," Jetson broke in perplexedly, "how
is the sinking of a British warship to be brought
about with safety to the plotters, and how is
the crime to be laid at the door of the American
Navy?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish to speak to the Ambassador on that
point before I mention it to any one else," Dave
answered.</p>

<p>"Have you told Dalzell?" pressed Jetson.</p>

<p>"I have not."</p>

<p>"He certainly hasn't," complained Danny Grin
sadly. "Dave always tells me after he has told
every one else."</p>

<p>"Danny boy," Dave rebuked him, "where do
you hope to go after you die?"</p>

<p>"Paris," Dalzell answered promptly.</p>

<p>Breakfast lasted until word came that the
Ambassador was ready to receive the two young
officers from the flagship of the Mediterranean
Fleet. Then Jetson left his friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Caine, to whom Mr. Lupton presently
introduced the ensigns, was a man in his fifties,
rather bald, and with a decided stoop in his
shoulders. At home he was a manufacturer
of barbed wire, and his business, as Danny later
suggested, had perhaps helped to give him some
of his keenness and sharpness. He was slenderly
fashioned, and reminded one, at first, of a professor
in a minor college.</p>

<p>It was when the Ambassador transacted business
that some of his sterling qualities came out.
He was recognized as being one of the cleverest
and ablest of American diplomats.</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you, gentlemen," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Ambassador, shaking hands with Dave and Dan
and then motioning them to seats, which an
attendant placed for them. "Mr. Lupton, you
have doubtless had Jetson's assurance that these
young men are the persons they claim to be?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Lupton rejoined.</p>

<p>"Then tell me all you can of this matter,"
urged Mr. Caine.</p>

<p>At a look from Second Secretary Lupton, the
attendant withdrew from the room. Dave and
Dan were soon deep in the narration of events
in which they participated at Monte Carlo and
at Naples.</p>

<p>"I know the young Comte of Surigny," remarked
Mr. Caine, "and I am deeply disappointed
to learn that he is among our foes, and in such a
mean capacity as the one in which he must be
employed. The young man comes from one of
the most ancient families in France, though he
has never been well-to-do, for his ancestors attended
to the insuring of his poverty. The gambling
streak has run through several generations
of the family."</p>

<p>Then Dave and Dan continued with their
story, Ambassador Caine paying close attention
to all they said.</p>

<p>"Gortchky is expected in Paris soon," announced
the Ambassador presently.</p>

<p>"Is he, sir?" Darrin asked quickly. "Would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it be indiscreet for me to ask if you know why he
is coming here?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing more definite than suspicion,"
replied Mr. Caine. "Paris, which has one of the
best detective systems of the world, is also noted
as being the principal headquarters for conspiracies
against governments. Not only do the
anarchists and nihilists look upon Paris as their
Mecca; but other scoundrels working out nefarious
plans for wicked governments also meet here to
lay their dastardly plots. Gortchky may be
coming here to secure new agents to take the
place of those already known to the Americans
who are watching him and his men; or he may
be coming here to hold a conference with the
men higher up, who are directing his scoundrelly
work against the peace of England and America."</p>

<p>"I take it, sir, that your secret service men will
make every effort to find out what Gortchky does
in Paris, and for what real purpose he is here,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Ensign Dave Darrin broke off abruptly,
coloring deeply.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he apologized hurriedly.
"I had no right to ask you such a
question."</p>

<p>"I have no objection to answering you," said
the Ambassador seriously. "Of course my men
will make every effort to find out what Gortchky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is up to here, if he comes to Paris, but I do not
know how well they will succeed. In the game of
making trouble between nations Emil Gortchky
is an old and wary bird. It may very likely be
that the fellow is coming to Paris only to try to
draw my secret service men into the worst kind
of a wild-goose chase leading only to clues that
are worse than worthless. Gortchky, in other
words, may be on his way to Paris only to draw
our attention away from vital moves about to
be made elsewhere by other members of his
rascally band. Of course, on due complaint, we
could have him arrested as a spy, and it would
go hard with him here in Paris before a military
court. But in that case there are others in the
band of plotters whom we do not know and
cannot locate. So, for very good reasons, we
prefer to have Gortchky at large."</p>

<p>"I would like immensely to see Gortchky in
Paris," Dave muttered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will have your wish," replied
Mr. Caine, with an odd smile.</p>

<p>Soon after that the interview came to an end,
but Dave and Dan remained in the Embassy
building through the day. An attendant was sent
out to get them what they needed in linen and
other small items.</p>

<p>Dinner was to be served at seven o'clock, and,
as Mr. Caine did not wish the presence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
young officers from the Mediterranean Fleet in
his house to be known, it was arranged that they
should dine in a smaller room alone with Mr.
Lupton.</p>

<p>At six, however, the Ambassador sent in haste
for Dave to come to his office.</p>

<p>"That invitation doesn't seem to include me,"
remarked Dalzell, rather ruefully, as he glanced
up from a book he was reading in the Embassy
library.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it doesn't," Dave returned.</p>

<p>Mr. Caine was at his office desk, holding a
telegram sheet in his hand.</p>

<p>"Gortchky is expected in town at 7.30 this
evening, Mr. Darrin," announced the Ambassador.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that I can do in this matter,
sir?" Darrin asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"You may go and watch for Gortchky, if you
think it possible to do so without his detecting
you," Mr. Caine replied slowly.</p>

<p>"The opportunity would delight me beyond
measure," Dave rejoined quickly. "I suppose
I had better take a taxicab that I may be ready
to give effective chase in case Emil Gortchky
uses that kind of transportation."</p>

<p>"I can supply you with a taxicab and with a
chauffeur who can be trusted," replied the Ambassador.
"The driver I have in mind is a
highly intelligent fellow who has many times been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
employed by me. And you can dismiss him at
any point, or retain him as long as you wish.
The bill for the taxicab charges will be sent to
the Embassy. How soon do you wish to have
this taxicab here?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should have it at once," Dave
replied. "Gortchky would know me in these
clothes at first glance, so it would be advantageous
if I arranged to disguise myself. On the streets,
as we came here, I noticed not a few young men
wearing baggy suits of clothes of most un-American
cut. They wore also flowing neckties, and some
of them had blue eyeglasses. There are so many
of these young men about that one more would
hardly attract Gortchky's attention. That style
of dress would make a good disguise for me."</p>

<p>"The young men you describe are largely
students and artists," replied the Ambassador.
"A disguise of that kind would be less conspicuous
than any other."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, if the chauffeur can come here
soon, he will have time to take me to stores where
I can get the articles of apparel I need, and I
shall still have plenty of time to meet Emil
Gortchky if he reaches Paris this evening. I
will go and tell Mr. Dalzell about Gortchky
being expected to arrive here to-night."</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Dalzell if you wish, but you had
better not take him with you," replied Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Caine. "Two young men would attract more
attention than one. I am approving of your
undertaking this because, to date, you have
learned more about this conspiracy than any
three of the secret service men whom I have at
my orders."</p>

<p>Dave hurried away to Dan, who was highly
disappointed at being left out of the evening's
work.</p>

<p>"But I have the joke on you, anyway," Danny
Grin suddenly declared.</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"I shall have my dinner," laughed Dalzell;
"you won't have any."</p>

<p>"I could forget my meals for three whole days
to stay on the trail of Gortchky," Dave answered,
simply.</p>

<p>Then he hurried out, for the arrival of the
taxicab was now announced. Darrin had a
minute's conversation with the chauffeur, after
which he entered the car.</p>

<p>One thing the young ensign quickly discovered,
and that was that on the smooth pavements of
Paris, and in the well-ordered traffic, taxicabs
travel at a high rate of speed. Within five minutes
he had been set down at the door of a shop in
which he found it possible to buy every item of
his disguise, even to shoes, for Darrin suddenly remembered
that his footwear was plainly American.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>In fifteen minutes more Dave Darrin emerged
from the store. In one hand he carried his discarded
clothing, packed in a new bag, which he
turned over to the chauffeur for safe keeping.
All of his money, except a small sum, he had
left behind at the Embassy.</p>

<p>If any policeman had seen him enter the shop
and come out again presenting so changed an
appearance, and if for that reason the policeman
should question him under the impression
that Darrin might be a spy, Dave decided that
he would rely upon his chauffeur to declare that
he had been hired at the American Embassy.
That statement would remove suspicion.</p>

<p>"You had better kill time for a few minutes,"
Dave explained to the chauffeur, who understood
English. "It is not desirable to reach the railway
station earlier than 7.20."</p>

<p>Accordingly the young ensign enjoyed a brief,
rapid panoramic view of a considerable part of
Paris. The driver, accustomed to taking Americans
about who were strangers in the city, frequently
turned his head to offer information as
to the places or points of interest that they were
passing.</p>

<p>"It's a shame that Danny boy isn't here to
enjoy all this," Dave told himself. "Even this
way of seeing Paris would be a great treat to
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost to the second of 7.20 the taxicab drew
up as one of a long line of similar vehicles under
the bright lights of the railway station.</p>

<p>Alighting, Ensign Darrin, feeling rather well
concealed in his disguise, and looking out through
his blue-lensed eyeglasses, strolled about, careful
not to saunter into the most brilliantly lighted
spots.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a train enter the station.
A thin stream of passengers filtered out. Dave
promptly shifted his position and watched the
arrivals, who later came out in a more compact
throng.</p>

<p>And there was Emil Gortchky, at last, with
no more marked hand luggage than a light cane,
which he swung jauntily.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't look my way, my fine bird!"
uttered Ensign Darrin under his breath. "But
if you do, your observation won't do you much
good."</p>

<p>A hand beckoned from a taxicab. Emil
Gortchky, who had been on the lookout, sauntered
over to the vehicle and clasped the hand
of M. le Comte de Surigny.</p>

<p>"Surigny, the ungrateful!" uttered Dave disgustedly
to himself. "I induced you to spare your
own worthless life, and then when you found life
sweet once more, you turned against me! I hope
you did not notice me as you sat in that cab."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Dave was at the side step of his
own taxicab. A few words to the chauffeur, and
he entered.</p>

<p>Surigny's cab drew out of the line, gliding away.
The one in which Dave sat gave chase at a cautious
distance.</p>

<p>Soon the speed of the leading cab increased,
and the pursuing one followed at the same speed.
After a considerable run both cabs turned into
the broad, well-lighted Boulevard Haussman.
For some blocks both cabs ran along. Then the
one ahead turned in before an imposing-looking
building with a gleaming white marble front.</p>

<p>"The Grand Prix Club," explained Dave's
chauffeur, glancing back as he stopped on the
other side of the boulevard some distance to
the rear.</p>

<p>It was the Count of Surigny who left the cab,
which then started forward.</p>

<p>"Is there gambling going on in that club?"
asked Darrin, as his man started the car forward
again.</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied the chauffeur, shrugging
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is easy to understand, then," Dave muttered
to himself. "Poor Surigny is no longer
his own master in anything, for he is a slave to
the gambling craze that ruins so many lives.
Gortchky furnishes the young man with money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
for gambling&mdash;lends it to him, of course, and
thus keeps the Count desperately in his debt.
And so the young Count has to do, when required,
the bidding of the scoundrel who gloats
over the helplessness of his dupe. Poor Surigny!"</p>

<p>Into less handsome avenues and streets the
taxicabs now turned. Then a distinctly shabby
looking part of Paris was unfolded to the gaze
of the young naval officer.</p>

<p>"The Rue d'Ansin," announced the chauffeur,
at last.</p>

<p>"A bad street?" Dave inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The haunt of criminals?"</p>

<p>"Criminals are seen here," the chauffeur explained,
"but their real lurking places are in
some of the alleys, farther along, that lead off
from the Rue d'Ansin. Late at night, monsieur,
it is better to ride through this street than to
be afoot on the sidewalk!"</p>

<p>"Is it the part of Paris where one would come
to meet or to confer with desperate criminals?"
Dave asked.</p>

<p>"Many of the Apaches live hereabouts," replied
the chauffeur, with another shrug.</p>

<p>Dave had read of these dangerous thugs, the
so-called "Apaches," native toughs of Paris,
who commit many bold robberies on the streets
by night, and even, sometimes, by day, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
who seldom hesitate to kill a victim or a policeman
if murder will render their own escape sure.</p>

<p>To an observer the Apache appears to be equally
without fear and without conscience. The Apache
is many degrees more dangerous than his more
cowardly cousin, the "gun-man" of New York.</p>

<p>"I hope you will not have to take to the streets
here, Monsieur," said the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"If I have to do that, I am not afraid to take
a chance," Darrin answered, imitating the Frenchman's
shrug with his own broad shoulders.</p>

<p>Ahead, Gortchky's taxicab was slowing down,
and the pursuing vehicle did the same. Dave
peered about to see if some one were waiting to
be taken up by Gortchky, but, instead, Gortchky
descended.</p>

<p>"Drive close to the curb on the other side of
the street," whispered Darrin. "Merely slow
down so that I may slip to the sidewalk. Then
go ahead, waiting for me around the corner two
blocks away."</p>

<p>"One block away would be better, Monsieur,"
urged the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Make it two," Dave insisted crisply.</p>

<p>Stepping out on the running board, Dave
leaned well forward, thus making it possible to
close the door of his car as it slowed down. Then,
as Dave stepped to the sidewalk, the taxicab
moved forward more rapidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Searching in an inner pocket, Emil Gortchky,
down the street on the other side, did not look
up, and apparently did not observe the maneuver
on the part of Dave's chauffeur. Dave slipped
quickly into a darkened doorway, from which he
could watch the international spy with little
danger of being observed.</p>

<p>Taking out a little packet of papers, and moving
toward a street lamp, Gortchky selected one of
the papers, thrusting the rest back into his
pocket. As he did so, one white bit fluttered to
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Reading under the street lamp the paper he
had selected, Gortchky put that particular paper
in another pocket. Then he turned abruptly,
plunging into the depths of an alley-like street.</p>

<p>Sauntering slowly across the street, in order
not to attract too much attention from other
passers on the badly lighted Rue d'Ansin, Ensign
Darrin, his gaze glued to that piece of paper,
soon reached it and picked it up.</p>

<p>"For that scoundrel to drop this paper, of
all others that he had in his pocket!" gasped
Dave Darrin, as, under the street light, he took
in its nature.</p>

<p>Then he paled, for this paper seemed to confirm
absolutely the young ensign's suspicion as
to the way in which the British battleship was
to be destroyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>All in a twinkling Dave's pallor vanished, for
he had something else to think about.</p>

<p>On the alley-like side street a quick step was
heard that Darrin recognized. It was that of
Emil Gortchky, hastily returning to find the paper
that he had dropped in the heart of Apache
Land!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>"SEEING" THE PARIS APACHES</h3>


<p>Like a flash Darrin thrust the paper into
one of his own pockets. Then he turned,
darting into a near-by doorway dark enough
to conceal him from Gortchky's eyes, if he should
look in that direction.</p>

<p>"I've no reason for fearing an encounter with
Gortchky, unless he knows how to summon the
murderous Apaches to his aid," Dave told himself
as he pressed back as far as he could into his
hiding place. "I don't want Gortchky, however,
to know I'm watching him, and I don't want to
lose this precious paper any more than he does."</p>

<p>Touching the door accidentally with the hand
that rested behind his back, Dave was delighted
to feel it swing slightly open. In another instant
he had backed into a corridor, softly closing
the door after him.</p>

<p>"Now Gortchky won't find me, and I'm all
right, unless I am discovered by one of the occupants
of this house, and turned over to the police
as a burglar!" thought the young naval officer
exultantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Gortchky's step, now slower, went by the door,
which Dave had left ajar by only the tiniest
crack.</p>

<p>"I cannot have lost that paper here, after
all," Dave heard the international spy mutter
in a low voice. "Certainly it has not been picked
up, for I came back almost instantly, and there
was no one near. It is not likely that I shall
ever see that important little bit of paper again."</p>

<p>Yet for a few moments longer Dave heard the
international spy moving about as though still
searching. Then the fellow's footsteps died out
as he went around the corner.</p>

<p>"I'll wait a few minutes before I step out,"
Darrin decided. "Gortchky may only be laying
a trap, and even at this instant he may be
peering around the corner to see if any one steps
out of one of these doorways."</p>

<p>Waiting for what seemed to be a long time, but
what was actually only a few minutes, the young
ensign stepped out to the sidewalk again.</p>

<p>There were a few people on his own side of
the block, and the sight of any one leaving a
house was not likely to arouse curiosity in the
minds of the denizens of that neighborhood.</p>

<p>As Dave neared the next corner, however,
four rough-looking fellows came out of a little
caf&eacute;. Their bearing was full of swagger. These
young men, in dress half student and half laborer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with caps pulled down over their eyes and gaily-knotted
handkerchiefs around their necks, displayed
the shifting, cunning look that is found
in the hoodlum everywhere.</p>

<p>As they reached the sidewalk, moving with
the noiseless step peculiar to the Apache, they
heard Darrin briskly coming along. Halting,
they regarded him closely as he neared them.</p>

<p>"They look like hard characters," Dave told
himself. "However, if I mind my business, I
guess they'll mind theirs."</p>

<p>It was not to be. One of the Apaches, the
tallest and slimmest of the lot, regarded Darrin
with more curiosity than did any of the others.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he cried. "See how stiffly our little
student carries himself! He must have been to
see his sweetheart, and feels proud of himself."</p>

<p>"He has the stride of a banker," jeered another.
"I wonder if he has his bank with him."</p>

<p>Dave's ear, quickly attuned to the French
tongue, caught and understood the words.</p>

<p>"Let me see what you look like," urged the
slim fellow, reaching out and plucking from
Darrin's nose the blue eye glasses just as Dave
was passing the group.</p>

<p>That gesture and the act were so insulting that
Ensign Darrin could not keep back the flash
that leaped into his eyes. He halted, regarding
the Apache steadily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, bless me! He's an American!" cried
the Apache. "All Americans are rich, you know.
My friend, have you a few sous for a group of
poor workingmen?"</p>

<p>Dave essayed to pass on. As he did so, a foot
was thrust out. Dave saw the movement and
leaped over the foot to avoid being tripped.</p>

<p>"At him!" hissed the slim Apache. "Let us
shake out his pockets."</p>

<p>Dave sprang forward, although he knew that
he could not hope to run away. Instead, he
leaped to a wall, placing his back against it. There
he halted, glaring defiantly at his assailants, his
fists up and ready for instant action.</p>

<p>"Sail in! Trim him!" snarled the slim one.
"If our little American shows fight&mdash;kill him!"</p>

<p>The first who reached Dave reeled back with
a broken nose, for Darrin's first was hard.</p>

<p>"Stick the pig!" cried the leader, meaning
that the young officer was to be stabbed. Not
one of the four had a knife, it seemed.</p>

<p>As they surrounded him, the one with the
injured nose having returned to the fray, that
slim Apache drew out a sandbag, long and narrow,
shaped like a sausage, made of canvas
and filled with sand. This is one of the most
deadly weapons in the world.</p>

<p>"Let us see what soothing medicine will do!"
he jeered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant all four had brought sandbags to
light, and all closed in upon the desperate
American.</p>

<p>"Come on, you cowards!" roared Dave, forgetting
his French and lapsing back into English.
"If I go out I'll take one of you with me."</p>

<p>Trying to tantalize their victim, the Apaches
made thrusts at Ensign Dave, and then leaped
nimbly back. It was their hope that he would
spring forward at them and thus leave his rear
unguarded. It is easiest to use the sandbag on
a victim from behind, though the tactics now
employed were favorites with the Apaches.</p>

<p>Dave had sense enough to divine the nature
of their trick. Unless the police arrived promptly
he expected to be killed by these jeering scoundrels,
but he was determined to sell his life dearly
enough.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young naval officer saw his chance
and used it. One of his dancing tormentors got
in too close. Darrin's right foot shot up and out,
landing across the Apache's knee-cap.</p>

<p>Uttering a howl of rage and pain, the fellow
all but crawled back.</p>

<p>"Kill the American," he howled. "Don't
play with him."</p>

<p>Instantly the three remaining assailants worked
in closer, yet with all the caution of their wily
natures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rush me!" taunted Dave, again in English.
"Don't be so afraid. If you mean to kill me
why don't you show courage enough to do it?
Come on, you sneaks!"</p>

<p>Though the Apaches could not understand
what the young ensign said to them, they knew
the drift of his jeering words. Their faces contorted
with rage, they struck at him, Dave's
arms working like piston rods in his efforts to
ward off their blows.</p>

<p>Close to the wall, slipping along on tip-toe
came a tall figure. Then suddenly a newcomer
leaped into the picture.</p>

<p>Biff! smash! Struck from behind in the
neck, two of the Apaches pitched forward, going
to earth. Dave Darrin, with a feint, followed
up with a swinging right-hand uppercut, laid
the last of the Apaches low, for the fellow sitting
in a doorway, nursing his knee and cursing, no
longer counted.</p>

<p>"Quick! Out of here!" ordered the newcomer,
seizing Dave by the arm and starting him along.</p>

<p>"Jetson!" gasped Ensign Darrin, looking into
the face of his rescuer.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered his brother officer. "Hurry
along!"</p>

<p>"Jetson, you've saved my life this time.
That pack of wolves would have killed me in
spite of my best defense."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're not out of trouble yet," retorted Jetson,
fairly pushing Darrin along. "Those Apaches
will revive in a few seconds."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Together, Jetson, we could thrash
half a dozen of their kind, and find it only exercise."</p>

<p>"But, my boy, don't you realize that there
are more than three or four Apaches around the
Rue d'Ansin? The alarm will sound, and a score
more will rush up. These rascals are sure death,
Darry, if they get at you in sufficient numbers!
The Parisians fear them. You don't see a single
citizen on the street now. Look! Every one of
them flew to cover as soon as the Apaches moved
into action. If bystanders interfered, or even
watched, they too would have to reckon with
these Apaches. Now, Darry, you're no coward,
and neither am I, but if you're wise you will
imitate me by taking to your heels."</p>

<p>Still holding Dave's arm lightly, Jetson sprinted
along to the next corner.</p>

<p>"To the right," whispered Dave. "I've a
taxicab here."</p>

<p>More than halfway down the block they saw
the car at the curb. The chauffeur, when Dave
called, stepped from a doorway in which he had
taken refuge.</p>

<p>"The Apaches!" gasped the driver.</p>

<p>"Hustle!" urged Dave. "Come on, Jetson."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>As the two young naval officers sprang into the
car, the driver leaped to his own seat. Pressing
the self-starter, the chauffeur soon had his machine
gliding along. Nor did he go back, either,
by way of the Rue d'Ansin.</p>

<p>Not until he was four blocks away from the
scene did the man ask for his orders.</p>

<p>"Back to the Embassy," Dave instructed him.
Then he remembered his comrade's swift, fine
rescue.</p>

<p>"Jetson," he asked, "did you know it was I
who was menaced by the Apaches?"</p>

<p>"I did not," replied his brother officer. "But
I heard enough, at a distance, to know that an
American was in trouble. In Paris that is sufficient
for me. Darry, I am delighted that I happened
along in time."</p>

<p>"You saved my life, Jetson, and at the risk of
your own. If you had missed one of the Apaches,
or had lost your balance, your career would have
been ended right there, along with mine."</p>

<p>"You risked your life for me, Darry, back in
the old Annapolis days, so we are even," answered
Jetson gently. "However, we won't keep books
on the subject of brotherly aid. All I can say,
Darry, is that I am glad I chose this night to
call on an artist who lives in dingy quarters
half a mile beyond where I found you. And I
am also glad that I did not accept his invitation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to supper, or I should have come along too late
to serve you."</p>

<p>As soon as the machine had left them at the
Embassy, Darrin sought out Mr. Lupton.</p>

<p>"May I see Mr. Caine at once?" asked the
young officer.</p>

<p>"You have seen Gortchky, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have found what I consider
positive proof as to the plans of Gortchky's
crew."</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Caine can be seen," replied
Lupton.</p>

<p>Ensign Darrin was soon with the American
Ambassador, who nodded to Lupton to leave
the room.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," began Darrin, "is a bit of
paper that Gortchky dropped and which I
picked up."</p>

<p>Mr. Caine scanned the paper.</p>

<p>"I do not see anything so very remarkable
about it," he replied.</p>

<p>Dave whispered a few words in his ear.</p>

<p>"Is that true?" asked the Ambassador, displaying
sudden agitation.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I believe you are right, Darrin,"
gasped the Ambassador, sinking back into
his chair, his face paling slightly. "Oh the
villains!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you believe, sir, that I have really discovered
the plot?" asked Dave, who looked only
a whit less agitated.</p>

<p>"If what you have just told me is true, then it
must be that you have made a correct guess."</p>

<p>"Will you send word by wireless to Admiral
Timworth, then, sir?"</p>

<p>"I dare not trust such news, even to the cipher,
which the international gang thought they had
filched, and which they did not get," replied
Mr. Caine. "I believe that the wisest course will
be for you to take the midnight train to Genoa."</p>

<p>"Then I shall take this paper with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Darrin, for the Admiral is far more
capable than I of estimating it at its true worth.
It is a matter for a naval man to comprehend and
decide."</p>

<p>The Ambassador did not neglect to provide the
young ensign with documents, approved by the
French Foreign Office, that would take them safely
over the border into Italy on their return trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>DAVE'S GUESS AT THE BIG PLOT</h3>


<p>"Friends tell me that in being in the Navy I
have such a grand chance to see the world,"
grumbled Dan Dalzell, as the launch headed
for the anchorage of the American warships.
"I went to Paris and had two short taxicab rides
through the city. That was all I saw of Paris.
Then a long railway journey, and I reached
Genoa. I spent twenty-eight minutes in Genoa,
and boarded this launch. Oh, I'm seeing the world
at a great rate! By the time I'm an admiral I
shall know nearly as much of the world as I did
when I studied geography in the Central Grammar
School of Gridley."</p>

<p>"Don't be a kicker, Danny boy," smiled Dave.
"And just think! When you get home, if any
one asks you if you've been in Paris, you can
say 'Yes.' Should any one ask you if you've seen
Genoa, you can hold up your head and declare
that you have."</p>

<p>"But my friends will ask me to tell them about
those towns," complained Dalzell.</p>

<p>"Read them up in the guide books," advised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Jetson, who was of the party. "I've known a lot
of Navy officers who got their knowledge of foreign
places in that way."</p>

<p>Dave and Dan had had but a fleeting glimpse
of the fine city that now lay astern of them.
Hundreds of sailormen and scores of officers, on
sight-seeing bent, had been ashore for two days.</p>

<p>But now the recall to the fleet had come. All
save Darrin, Dalzell and Jetson, with Seaman
Runkle, who was now up forward on the launch,
were already aboard their respective ships. The
Admiral waited only for the coming of this launch
before he gave the sailing order.</p>

<p>Jetson was assigned to the battleship "Allegheny,"
a craft only a trifle smaller than the
massive "Hudson."</p>

<p>The three brother officers and Runkle had
traveled by express from Paris to Genoa, and had
come through without incident. At last even the
watchful Runkle was convinced that they had
eluded all spies.</p>

<p>"Boatswain's Mate," said Dave, "as this
launch belongs to the flagship, it will be better to
take Mr. Jetson, first, over to his ship."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," responded the man in charge
of the launch.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Dave Darrin found himself
leading his own party up over the side of the
"Hudson."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain Allen wishes to see Ensigns Darrin
and Dalzell at once," announced Lieutenant
Cranston, the officer of the deck. "You will
report to the Captain without further instructions."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," Dave answered, saluting.</p>

<p>Exactly ten minutes later the two young ensigns
were ushered into the presence of their
commanding officer.</p>

<p>"Admiral Timworth has been notified by wireless
from Paris that you have important communications
to make to him," began the Captain.
"I will not waste your time or the Admiral's in
questioning you here. You will come with me
to the fleet commander's quarters. The Admiral
is awaiting you."</p>

<p>Admiral Thomas Timworth, seated at his
desk, and with his flag lieutenant standing by,
greeted his callers with exceeding briskness.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "time presses, and we
must dispense with formalities. Ensign Darrin,
I am advised by the Ambassador at Paris of the
importance of your news, but he does not tell me
what the news is."</p>

<p>"Its importance, sir, depends on whether the
evidence I have to present supports the guess I
have made as to the nature of the plot that has
been planned against the peace and safety of Great
Britain and our own country."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>As Dave spoke he produced from an inner
pocket the sheet of paper dropped by Gortchky,
that he had picked up in the Rue d'Ansin.</p>

<p>"This piece of paper, sir," Darrin continued,
passing it to the fleet commander, "is one that
I <i>saw</i> Emil Gortchky drop from a packet of
several papers that he took from his pocket at
night on one of the worst streets in the slums of
Paris."</p>

<p>Admiral Timworth scanned the paper, then
read it aloud. It was a receipted bill, made out
in the name of one unknown to those present,
though perhaps an alias for Gortchky himself.
The bill was for a shipment of storage batteries.
At the bottom of the sheet was a filled-in certificate
signed by a French government official, to the effect
that the batteries had been shipped into Italy
"for laboratory purposes of scientific research."
Just below this statement was an official Italian
certificate of approval, showing that the batteries
had been admitted into Italy. In time of war,
with the frontier guarded tenfold more <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vigilant'">vigilantly</ins>
than in ordinary times, such certificates are
vitally necessary to make shipments from France
into Italy possible.</p>

<p>"In other words, sir," Dave went on eagerly,
when the fleet commander scanned his face
closely, "it needed some very clever underhand
work, very plausibly managed, to make it possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to buy those batteries in France and to secure their
admittance into Italy."</p>

<p>"Why?" quizzed Admiral Timworth, as though
he did not know the answer himself.</p>

<p>"Because, sir," Dave went on keenly, full of
professional knowledge of the subject, "these
batteries are the best that the French make for
use aboard submarines."</p>

<p>"True," nodded the fleet commander. "What
then?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, by the use of the cleverest kind of
lying that spies can do, Gortchky and his associates
have hoodwinked the French and Italian
governments into believing that the batteries
are to be lawfully used for research purposes, when,
as a matter of fact, they are to be used aboard a
submarine which the plotters intend to use for
destroying a British battleship."</p>

<p>"We will admit, then," said Admiral Timworth,
as a poser, "that the plotters have probably
gotten into Italy storage batteries that can be
used serviceably on a submarine. But where and
how can the plotters have obtained the submarine
craft itself? Or, if they haven't got it yet, how
are they to obtain one? For submarines are not
sold in open market, and it would be difficult to
steal one."</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that, as yet, sir," Dave admitted
gravely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"And such storage batteries might be used for
purposes of scientific research," continued the
fleet commander.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but the habits of the buyers should
be considered, should they not? Gortchky and
his associates can be hardly believed to be interested
in science. On the other hand, they
are arch plotters, which would lead us to suppose
that they have bought these batteries to further
a plot. Outside of scientific work the batteries
would not be likely to be used anywhere except
on board a submarine. Storage batteries of different
size and pattern are used for industrial
purposes, but those described in this bill are used
on board submarines."</p>

<p>"Your reasoning is plausible, Darrin, and probably
correct, too," nodded Admiral Timworth.</p>

<p>"Besides which, sir," Dave pressed home, "if
we admit that the plotters have conspired to sink
a British battleship at Malta, the easiest way in
war-time, when unidentified strangers cannot get
aboard a warship, would be to effect the sinking
by means of a submarine's torpedo. And, if this
be the plan of the plotters, then the crime is likely
to be attempted only when there are British and
American war craft, and none others, in the
Grand Harbor of Malta."</p>

<p>"Yet surely the plotters must know that, between
good friends like Britain and America, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would take more than the mere sinking of a
British ship to make the English suspect us, as
a nation, of being involved in such a dastardly
plot."</p>

<p>"Our country couldn't be suspected, as a government
or a nation, of being guilty of such a wicked
deed," Dave answered. "But Englishman and
Frenchmen might very easily believe that the
torpedoing was the work of a group of officers
and men in our Navy who hated England enough
to strike her below the belt. With the British
ship sunk, sir, and with none to suspect but the
Americans, there is no telling to what heights
British passion might rise. The British are feeling
the tension of the great war severely, sir."</p>

<p>"There is one flaw in your reasoning, Mr. Darrin,"
Admiral Timworth replied. "We will admit
that the torpedoing happens at a time when only
American and British war craft are visible in
Grand Harbor. Why would it not be wholly
reasonable for the British to suppose that the
torpedoing was the work of a German submarine
that had sneaked into the harbor of Malta under
the surface of the water?"</p>

<p>"That occurred to me, sir," Dave admitted,
"and at first I couldn't find the answer, but at
last I did."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to hear that answer."</p>

<p>"The submarine, let us suppose, sir, discharges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
one torpedo with such accuracy as to sink the
British battleship. Why could not another torpedo
be fired immediately, which would not
strike, but would rise to the surface and be afterwards
identified when found as an American
torpedo? For a torpedo that does not strike and
explode can be so adjusted that it will afterwards
sink or rise and float. And this torpedo that
rises can be of American pattern."</p>

<p>"But where would the plotters secure an American
torpedo?" demanded Admiral Timworth.</p>

<p>"The plotters, if they had a secret factory,
could make some torpedoes of the American type,
provided they had obtained the services of a
draftsman and workmen familiar with the American
torpedo."</p>

<p>"That could be accomplished, in this wicked
old world of ours," nodded Admiral Timworth,
after an interval of deep thought. "I won't declare
that I think it really has been done. Yet
your various reports to me, Mr. Darrin, convince
me that plotters really intend to sink a British
battleship and lay the blame at our country's
door. And such a deed might really provoke
English clamor for war with our country."</p>

<p>In the Admiral's quarters a long silence followed.</p>

<p>At length the fleet commander looked up.</p>

<p>"Captain Allen," he asked, "what do you think
of Mr. Darrin's surmise?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"It looks probable to me," said the "Hudson's"
commanding officer promptly.</p>

<p>"It looks likely to me, also," sighed Admiral
Timworth.</p>

<p>Then the famous old sea-dog brought his
clenched fist down on his desk with a bang.</p>

<p>"Malta shall be our next stop," he declared.
"We shall see whether any band of plotters can
put such a plot through while we are watching!
All mankind would shudder at such a tragedy.
All the world would side with England and condemn
the United States and her Navy! Gentlemen,
I now believe that Mr. Darrin has revealed
the details of a plan that will be tried. We must
prevent it, gentlemen! We shall prevent it&mdash;or
some of us will lose our lives in the effort to
stop it! Darrin, you shall have your chance in
helping us to stop it. Mr. Dalzell, you, too,
shall have your chance! And now&mdash;Malta."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>SURIGNY'S NEXT MOVE</h3>


<p>In the Grand Harbor, overlooked by the town
and fortress of Valetta, on the island of Malta,
there lay at anchor the British dreadnaught
"Albion," the cruiser "Wrexham" and the gunboat
"Spite."</p>

<p>Less than half a mile away lay the American
battleships "Hudson" and "Allegheny" and the
cruiser "Newton."</p>

<p>It was early evening now. During the day,
soon after the arrival of the American craft, the
usual visits of courtesy had been exchanged between
the two fleets.</p>

<p>Admiral Barkham, of His Majesty's Navy,
received a most disagreeable shock while in conference
in Admiral Timworth's quarters. In other
words, he had been accurately informed of all
that was so far known to the American fleet
commander.</p>

<p>"But it is impossible," declared Admiral Barkham.
"Quite impossible!"</p>

<p>"It would seem so," replied Admiral Timworth.
"Yet the outcome will be the best proof in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
matter. Sir, with your help, I propose to catch
that submarine, should she appear in these
waters."</p>

<p>"She will not appear," declared the Englishman.
"I am convinced that such a thing is impossible.
Only madmen would undertake to accomplish
such a horrible thing. True, we have
enemies who employ submarines in this war, but
they do not dare to use them in attacking battleships.
Nor would plotters without the backing
of a government dare try it."</p>

<p>Then Admiral Timworth caused Ensigns Darrin
and Dalzell to be summoned. They came.
Admiral Barkham listened to their story, his gaze
all the time fixed on their earnest faces.</p>

<p>It was impossible to doubt the word of two such
intelligent young officers. Admiral Barkham
found his doubts vanishing. He was prepared to
admit that such a crime as he had heard discussed
might be in course of planning.</p>

<p>"Of course I know the fellow Gortchky," admitted
Admiral Barkham, "and also that trouble-breeder,
Dalny. Yet this is something amazingly
more desperate than they have ever attempted
before. I now admit, sir," turning to Admiral
Timworth, "that there is good reason to suppose
that such a plot may be afoot."</p>

<p>"The 'Maine' was sunk in Havana Harbor,"
rejoined the American Admiral, dryly. "That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
incident sent two nations to war. Might not
something like the 'Maine' affair be attempted
here in Valetta Harbor?"</p>

<p>Sitting with bowed head the British admiral
looked most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"At all events," he said, "it is certainly a
matter of duty for the officers of both fleets to be
on the lookout, and for them to work in concert.
Yet I still find it all but impossible to believe what
my judgment tells me might be possible."</p>

<p>"You are going to advise the officers of your
fleet, then?" asked Admiral Timworth.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied the Englishman slowly.</p>

<p>"In the American fleet," said Admiral Timworth,
"very few officers will be told outside of
those who are going to be charged with keeping a
lookout for the submarine."</p>

<p>At a sign Dave and Dan withdrew, leaving the
two fleet commanders in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>"It's hard for an Englishman to conceive of
such a crime as being possible, isn't it?" asked
Dan, with a melancholy grin.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's to the honor of his manhood that
he cannot believe in it," Dave answered gently,
as the chums sat in the latter's quarters.</p>

<p>Dave and Dan had been excused from ship duty
on account of other duties that were likely to be
assigned to them at any time.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 261px;">
<img src="images/illus-198.jpg" width="261" height="400" alt="&quot;Admiral Barkham listened to their story.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Admiral Barkham listened to their story.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Half an hour after the chums left the Admiral's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
quarters an orderly summoned them to Captain
Allen's office.</p>

<p>"Both admirals are convinced," said Captain
Allen, when Dave and Dan had reported, "that
the crime, if it is to be attempted, will be tried
at night. As there are still a few hours before
dark Admiral Timworth wishes you to take one
of the launches and go alongside the British flagship.
There will you find three or four young
British officers ready to join you. You will all
go ashore in Valetta and remain there until
nearly dark. You will circulate about the town,
as sight-seers usually do. While ashore you will
keep your eyes open for glimpses of the Gortchky-Dalny
plotters and their subordinates, whom you
may find there. Admiral Timworth particularly
desires to know whether any of that unsavory
crew have reached Malta."</p>

<p>The launch being ready alongside, Dave and
Dan, both in uniform, went at once over the side.
They were soon alongside the "Albion," and a
voice from deck invited them aboard. There the
officer of the deck introduced them to four young
English officers. Three minutes later the party
went aboard the launch, and headed toward shore.</p>

<p>Outside of the forts and garrison buildings the
town is a small one, though at this time there were
several places of amusement open on two of the
principal streets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Through these places the party strolled, seemingly
bent only on having a good time.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of the bally spies?" murmured
one of the young English officers, Whyte
by name.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of one," Dave answered in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"What if they're not here?" persisted Whyte.</p>

<p>"It may be that none of them will show up at
Malta," Darrin answered. "Or it may be that
those who do come will come only on that submarine
we are looking for."</p>

<p>"I would like to meet one of those plotters,"
grumbled Dorcliffe, another of the English party
and the possessor of a bulky frame and broad
shoulders.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked Dave smilingly.</p>

<p>"I believe I'd jolly well choke the breath out of
him!" asserted Mr. Dorcliffe.</p>

<p>"That would betray the fact that we know the
gang and the work that they're planning," Dave
returned.</p>

<p>"Would it?" asked Mr. Dorcliffe, looking
thoughtful. "Oh, I say! It's bally hard work
to contend with such bounders. Why can't all
men fight in the open?"</p>

<p>"Real men do," Dave answered. "The fellows
we are trying to run down are not real men.
Beings who can do wholesale murder for pay are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
bad beyond the comprehension of honest
men."</p>

<p>"But we're not finding any one that we want to
see," complained Sutton, another of the English
party.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to find that crew on parade,"
Dave replied, "and I think it extremely likely
that none of them is now in Valetta or on the
Island of Malta."</p>

<p>Then all fell silent, for the leaders of the party
had turned in at one of the caf&eacute;s most frequented
by visitors.</p>

<p>There were but few people at the tables.
Glancing across the room Dave felt a sudden
throb of astonishment and disgust.</p>

<p>Hastily rising from a table was a young man
who averted his face.</p>

<p>"There's the Count of Surigny!" whispered
Dave to Whyte.</p>

<p>An instant later a door at the side of the room
closed almost noiselessly, with the young French
nobleman on the other side of it.</p>

<p>"Did you see that fellow?" Dave demanded,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"We did," came the acknowledgment of
Dave's group.</p>

<p>"That is Surigny," Darrin informed them.
"He is the fellow whom I saved from suicide at
Monte Carlo, and now he is in the ranks of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
men who have planned the worst crime of the
twentieth century. Surigny is now where his
follies have placed him&mdash;associated with the
vilest creatures who disgrace the name of Man!"</p>

<p>The party had seated themselves at a table
where beverages and refreshments are served. A
tireless Italian soprano and a Russian tenor
were grinding out some of the stock music of the
place. Two dancers were waiting to follow them.</p>

<p>The naval officers looked bored. They were
not in this caf&eacute; for pleasure, but strictly for
business&mdash;that of national honor.</p>

<p>A waiter strolled leisurely into the room, looked
about, then approached the table at which the
American and English officers were seated. Dropping
a towel at Dave's side, the waiter bent over
to pick it up, at the same time slyly pressing into
Dave's hand a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Holding it under the table and glancing at it,
Dave found it carried a brief message in French.
Translated, it read:</p>

<p>"For vital reasons, I beg you to follow the
waiter, who can be trusted, and come to me at
once. Come alone and secretly. Honor depends
upon your compliance!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S."</p>

<p>"Surigny!" muttered Ensign Darrin, disgustedly,
under his breath. "That impossible scoundrel!
He has sold himself to those plotters, and
now would betray me. The wretch!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, after a moment's thought, Dave decided
to see the man.</p>

<p>Bending over, Dave whispered to Dan the
message contained in the note.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" quivered Dan, his eyes
flashing indignation.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I?"</p>

<p>"You will remain here, Dan. Tell the others
if you can do so without being overheard. Make
my excuses after I have left you."</p>

<p>Then, his head erect, his heart pumping indignantly,
Dave Darrin rose and sought the waiter,
who lingered at the end of the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>TRUTH, OR FRENCH ROMANCE</h3>


<p>"You know what is expected of you?" Dave
asked the waiter, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master," replied the man, a
Maltese who spoke English with an odd accent.</p>

<p>"Then I will follow you," Darrin added.</p>

<p>At the heels of the waiter Dave went through
a narrow corridor, then climbed a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Pausing before a door, the waiter knocked
softly, four times.</p>

<p>"<i>Entrez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i>" ("Come in, if you
please"), a voice answered.</p>

<p>Throwing open the door, the waiter bowed and
swiftly departed.</p>

<p>Ensign Dave Darrin stepped inside, closed the
door, and found himself face to face with the Count
of Surigny.</p>

<p>That young Frenchman, his face unwontedly
pale, searched Dave's face with his eyes.</p>

<p>"You are not glad to see me," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Do I show it?" inquired Darrin, his face without
expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not glad to see me," Surigny went on
rather sadly. "Then it is because you suspect."</p>

<p>"Suspect&mdash;what?" Dave demanded, to gain
time.</p>

<p>"You know the company that I have been
keeping," the young Count continued.</p>

<p>"Has it been the wrong kind of company for a
gentleman to keep?" Ensign Darrin asked coldly.</p>

<p>"You know!" cried the Count bitterly.</p>

<p>"Then," asked Dave, "is it indiscreet for me
to ask why you have permitted yourself to associate
with such company?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if you would believe me," replied
Surigny, wincing.</p>

<p>"Is there any good reason why I should believe
you?" Dave returned, studying the Frenchman's
face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps none so good as the fact that I am a
gentleman," the Count of Surigny answered
more boldly. "The word of a gentleman is always
sacred."</p>

<p>"May I ask to what this talk is leading?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to proceed with you,"
complained the young Frenchman. "Once you
did me a great service. You taught me to live
and that to die by my own hand was cowardice.
Monsieur, you taught me how to be a man."</p>

<p>"And you have remembered the lesson?" Dave
inquired, with the same expressionless face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I at least know," the Frenchman returned,
"that a man should remember and serve his
friends."</p>

<p>"Then you have been serving me?"</p>

<p>"I have been working hard, swallowing insult
and stifling my sense of decency as far as possible,
in order that I might serve you and prove myself
worthy to be your friend," replied Surigny, with
such earnestness that Darrin now found himself
staring in open-eyed astonishment at the young
nobleman.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are going to try to offer me particulars
of how you have been preparing to serve
me," Dave said with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," cried the Frenchman, as if in sudden
desperation, "are you prepared to accept my
word as you would wish your own to be accepted?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be asking considerable of a comparative
stranger?"</p>

<p>"Then answer me upon your own honor, Monsieur
Darrin," the Count of Surigny appealed
eagerly. "Do you consider me a gentleman or&mdash;a
rascal?"</p>

<p>Ensign Dave opened his lips, then paused. He
was now asked to speak on his own honor.</p>

<p>His pallor giving way to a deep flush, Surigny
suddenly opened his lips to speak again.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darrin," he urged, his voice quavering,
"do me the honor to look in my eyes. Study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
me from the viewpoint of an honest man. Tell
me whether you will believe what I have to say
to you. Do not be too quick. Take time to
think."</p>

<p>As Dave found himself gazing into the depths
of the other's eyes, and as he studied that appealing
look, he felt his contempt for Surigny
rapidly slipping away.</p>

<p>"Now, speak!" begged M. le Comte de Surigny.
"Will you believe what I am about to tell you, as
one man of honor speaks to another?"</p>

<p>For an instant Ensign Dave hesitated. Then
he answered quickly:</p>

<p>"Yes; I will believe you, Monsieur le Comte."</p>

<p>"In doing so, do you feel the slightest hesitation?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," rejoined Darrin, a slight smile
parting his lips, "I am assailed by some doubts
as to whether I am wise in doing so, but I will believe
what you have to say to me. I prefer to
believe you to be, of your own choice, a man of
honor."</p>

<p>Surigny uttered a cry of delight. Then he went
on:</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Monsieur Darrin, you will even be
willing to set me the example in truthfulness by
telling me whether you know of the plot of those
with whom I have had the shame of being associated."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will doubtless recall, Monsieur le Comte,
since it was said only a moment ago, that I promised
only to believe what you might have to say
to me. I did not promise to tell you anything."</p>

<p>Indeed, at this point, Ensign Dave was perilously
near to breaking his word as to believing
Surigny. It looked to him as if the Frenchman
were "fencing" in order to extract information.</p>

<p>"Well, then," exclaimed Surigny, with a gesture
of disappointment, "I will tell you that which I
feel I must. Listen, then. With Gortchky,
Mender, Dalny and others, I have been engaged
in a plan to cause a British warship to be sunk in
the harbor yonder, and under circumstances such
as to make it appear as the work of you Americans.
Did you know that, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Go on," urged Dave Darrin.</p>

<p>"At first," murmured the Count, coming closer,
"I believed Gortchky's statement that I was
being engaged in secret diplomatic service. When
I learned the truth, I was deeply involved with
the miserable crew. Also, I was very much in
debt, for Gortchky was ever a willing lender.</p>

<p>"There came a day, Monsieur, when there
dawned on me the vileness of the wicked plot in
which I had become engaged. For a few hours
I felt that to destroy myself was the only way in
which I could retrieve my honor. But the lesson
you had taught served me well in those hours of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
need. Then the thought of you, an officer in the
American Navy, brought a new resolve into my
mind. No pledges that I had ignorantly made to
such scoundrels could bind me. I was not their
slave. Pledges to do anything that could bring
dishonor upon one are not binding on a man of
honor. I did not even feel a sense of debt to
Gortchky, for he had used the money with evil
intentions. From the moment of these realizations
I had but one object in view. I would go
on taking such money as I needed, and with no
thought of the debt; and I would serve these
monsters with such seeming fidelity that I could
at last find my way open to serving <i>you</i> fully,
Monsieur Darrin. I pause for an instant. Do
you believe all that I have just told you, my
friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dave. The next second he
caught himself wondering if, through that "yes,"
he had unintentionally lied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE ALLIES CLEAR FOR ACTION</h3>


<p>"I left Naples for this island on an east-bound
liner," continued the Count of Surigny.
"Not until within an hour of sailing did I
know the whole of the terrible story that now
spoils my sleep at night and haunts me by day.
Monsieur Darrin, if you have scented any dreadful
plot, at least I do not believe you know just
what it is."</p>

<p>Once more the young Frenchman paused.
Dave, however, having regained his expressionless
facial appearance, only said:</p>

<p>"Go on, Monsieur le Comte."</p>

<p>"Then I have but to tell you what the plot
is," resumed Surigny. "Gortchky, Mender, Dalny
and others knew that the American fleet would
stop at Malta, because American fleets in these
waters always do stop at Malta. They knew also
that a British fleet often remains here for months
at a time. So these arch scoundrels knew to
a certainty that the 'Hudson' of your Navy
would be here in due course of time. In a word,
every plan has been made for sinking a British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
battleship here at Malta under circumstances
which will make it appear to be plainly the work
of a group of American naval men."</p>

<p>Darrin, still silent, steadily eyed the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"You do not start!" uttered Surigny, in amazement.
"Then it must be because you already
know of the plot!"</p>

<p>"Go on, please," urged Dave quietly.</p>

<p>"The plan must have been made long ago,"
the Frenchman continued, "for, before August,
1914, before the great war started, though just
when I do not know, Gortchky and the others,
or their superiors, had a submarine completed
at Trieste. It was supposed to be a secret order
placed for the Turkish government. The craft
was not a large one. Gortchky and some associates
took the submarine out for trial themselves.
Days later they returned, reporting that the
underseas craft had foundered, but that they
had escaped to land in a collapsible boat. Most
of the payments on the submersible had already
been made. Gortchky paid the balance without
protest, and the matter was all but forgotten.</p>

<p>"I do not know what reason Gortchky had
given the builder, if indeed he offered any explanation,
but the tubes in the submarine had
been made of the right dimensions and fitted
with the right mechanism to fire the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
torpedo. And a man whom I judge to have been
a German spy in America before the war&mdash;a
German who had served as draftsman in the
employ of an American munitions firm&mdash;was
at Trieste to furnish the design for both the
torpedo tubes and for the four American torpedoes
that the Trieste firm also supplied.</p>

<p>"You will have divined, of course, Monsieur
Darrin," Surigny continued, "that the submarine
was not lost, but concealed at a point somewhere
along the shores of the Mediterranean until
wanted. So far ahead do some enemies plot!
Where the submarine has remained during the
interval I do not know, but I do know that,
submerged only deep enough for concealment,
she has been towed to these waters recently by
relays of fishing boats manned by Maltese traitors
to Britain. Ah, those rascally Maltese! They
know no country and they laugh at patriotism.
They worship only the dollar, and are ever ready
to sell themselves! And the submarine will
endeavor to sink the British battleship to-night!"</p>

<p>"To-night!" gasped Darrin, now thoroughly
aroused.</p>

<p>"To-night," Surigny nodded, sadly, his face
ghastly pale. "Even the yacht that carries the
plotters is here."</p>

<p>"These are hardly the times," Dave remarked,
"when it would seem to any naval commander<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
a plausible thing for a yacht to cruise in the
submarine-infested Mediterranean. And, if the
plotters are using and directing the movements
of a yacht, I am unable to see how they could
obtain clearance papers from any port."</p>

<p>"Oh, the yacht's sailing papers are correct,"
Surigny declared, eagerly. "The yacht has
Russian registry and is supposed to be sold to
Japanese buyers to be put in trade between
the United States and Japan, carrying materials
from which the Japanese make Russian munitions
of war. So you will see how plausible it is
to be engaged in transferring a Russian yacht
to Japanese registry at this time."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Darrin. "It seems a
stupid thing, indeed, for any Japanese shipping
firm to buy a low, narrow craft, like the typical
yacht, to convert her into a freighter."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the yacht is neither low nor narrow,"
replied Surigny. "She is a craft of some three
thousand tons, broad of beam and with plenty
of freeboard."</p>

<p>"What flag does she fly?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"That I do not know," was the Count's answer.
"It may be that she does not fly any. Two of
her passengers are reported to be a Russian
prince and a Japanese marquis. But Monsieur
Mender is not a Russian at all, and no more a
prince than he is a Russian. As for the Japanese,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
he is merely a Filipino, once a mess attendant
in your Navy, and now a deserter, for he hates
your country."</p>

<p>"When will the yacht reach these waters?"
Dave inquired.</p>

<p>"As I have said, she is here already, or as near
as she will come," the Frenchman continued.
"At noon she was at anchorage in the channel
between the islands of Comino and Gozo. It is
known as the North Channel."</p>

<p>"I know the spot," said Dave, nodding.
"Comino is the little island that is used as a
quarantine station. Monsieur le Comte, do
you know anything more, of importance, that
you have not already told me?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darrin, I believe that nothing of
importance has been left out of my narrative.
But you believe me? You will now accept my
hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dave burst out, extending his hand
almost impulsively. M. le Comte Surigny seized
it delightedly.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is good, it is grand!" cried the young
Frenchman, "after such associates as I have
had for weeks, to find myself again fit for the
confidence and the friendship of a gentleman!"</p>

<p>"But what will become of you?" asked Dave,
a feeling of regret suddenly assailing him. "What
will become of you, my dear Surigny? Is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
likely that the plotters, if they be foiled, will
suspect you? Is it likely that they would seek
your life as a forfeit?"</p>

<p>"What is my life?" laughed the Frenchman
gayly. "I have never valued it highly, but now,
when I have won back my self-respect, a blow
in the dark would be but a mark of honor. If
they wish to kill me, let them. It would be a
glorious death, in the cause of honor!"</p>

<p>Dave glanced out of the window, then gave a
start of alarm.</p>

<p>"Time is passing," he murmured. "I must take
my information where it will be of the most
service. And you, Surigny, may I take the liberty,
without waiting to ask our Admiral's leave, of
inviting you to accept the hospitality of the flagship?
Will you come on board with me?"</p>

<p>"Afterward," replied the Frenchman. "Afterward,
when the truth of what I have told you is
recognized."</p>

<p>"Where will you stay for the present, then?"</p>

<p>"Where I am now," smiled the Count.</p>

<p>Dave took one long step forward, again gripping
Count Surigny's right hand with both his own
hands.</p>

<p>"Surigny, I am under more obligations than I
can ever repay. Few men with the instinct of
a gentleman could have endured, for weeks,
having to associate with and serve such rascals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as this grewsome crew. You have, indeed,
proved yourself noble, and I deeply regret that
I have ever allowed myself to distrust and dislike
you."</p>

<p>"Let us say no more," begged the Count.
"After the chase is over&mdash;and may you win the
game&mdash;you will find me here, reveling in the
thought that I have been able to warn you so
completely."</p>

<p>Had it not been that he again remembered how
late it was growing, Ensign Darrin would have
remained longer with this now bright-faced
Frenchman. As it was, Dave tore himself away
from Surigny, and lost no time in rejoining his
party below.</p>

<p>As Dave stepped to the table, Lieutenant
Whyte, of the British Navy, raised his eyebrows
in slight interrogation. None spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't know," smiled Darrin, "how it goes
with you gentlemen of England, but I am sure
Dalzell will agree with me that it is time to get
back to our ship."</p>

<p>"It is," Dalzell affirmed, taking the cue.</p>

<p>The score was settled, after which the party
left the hotel. Dave stepped to Whyte's side.
Through the streets of the little town the party
passed quickly by twos, gayly chatting. Once
they were clear of the streets and near the mole
Dave began:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Whyte, the moment for action is at hand.
Surigny sent for me, and I believe he has told
me the truth. He felt under obligations, and,
when invited, joined the international plotters
in order to find out how he could serve me. He
has told me that a yacht bearing the supervising
plotters is now anchored in North Channel, and
that the submarine is concealed somewhere under
neighboring waters. It is the intention of the
plotters to attempt to sink one of your ships
to-night."</p>

<p>"Do you believe the fellow?" demanded Whyte
in a shocked tone.</p>

<p>"At first I found it hard to believe him," Dave
admitted, "but now I believe that he told me
the truth."</p>

<p>"And if he has not?" questioned the British
officer.</p>

<p>"In any event, Whyte, the yacht must be
watched. However, your Admiral Barkham will
have to decide what action shall be taken."</p>

<p>"Do you know whether others of the crew,
besides Surigny, are in Valetta?" Whyte asked.</p>

<p>"I did not ask Surigny," Dave rejoined.
"Indeed, it is not important to know. What we
must do is to catch the submarine; the conspirators
may wait for subsequent overhauling."</p>

<p>At Darrin's signal the launch from the flagship
promptly put off. Darrin ordered that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
English officers be put aboard their own ship
first. As the launch drew alongside the "Albion"
Dave added:</p>

<p>"Mr. Whyte, I shall wait until you ascertain
whether your Admiral has any message to send
to Admiral Timworth. That, of course, would
be after hearing your report."</p>

<p>For ten minutes the "Hudson's" launch lay
alongside the "Albion." Then Mr. Whyte appeared,
coming nimbly down the gangway and
stepping into the launch.</p>

<p>"With Admiral Barkham's compliments, I am
to carry a message to Admiral Timworth,"
Whyte announced. "I am also to inquire whether
your Captain desires a conference with Admiral
Timworth before I deliver my message."</p>

<p>Dave conducted the English officer aboard the
American flagship. Captain Allen soon received
them. He heard Ensign Darrin's report, then
telephoned to Admiral Timworth for permission
to bring to his quarters the English admiral's
representative, together with his own youngest
officers.</p>

<p>Admiral Timworth received them, listening
attentively to the report that Dave had to make
of his conversation with the Count of Surigny.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that the Frenchman was
telling the truth?" the fleet commander inquired.
Dave answered in the affirmative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does your message from Admiral Barkham
concern the Frenchman's report?" inquired Admiral
Timworth, turning to Whyte, who had
kept modestly in the background.</p>

<p>"It does, sir," Lieutenant Whyte answered,
stepping forward. "Admiral Barkham's compliments,
sir, and he has used the wireless to the
quarantine station on Comino Island. Such a
yacht as the Count of Surigny described is at
anchor in North Channel, and is reported to have
a Russian prince and a Japanese nobleman on
board. So Admiral Barkham gives at least that
much credence to the Frenchman's story."</p>

<p>Whyte paused a moment, that Admiral Timworth
might speak, if he chose, then continued:</p>

<p>"Admiral Barkham imagines, sir, that you
would like to have a share in searching the yacht
and in guarding against submarine attack. To
that end, sir, he signaled to the military governor
at Malta and secured the latter's assent to a
plan of having the American naval forces co-operate
with us in running down the plot."</p>

<p>"Of course we shall be glad to aid," declared
Admiral Timworth, heartily, "and we are much
complimented over being invited to help you in

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>MAKING STERN WORK OF IT</h3>


<p>Lieutenant Whyte then unfolded,
briefly, the plan of Admiral Barkham for
procedure against the yacht and the submarine.
To these plans Admiral Timworth
quickly agreed.</p>

<p>"We have four large launches on the flagship,"
the fleet commander stated. "Three of these
shall be put over the side, officered and manned
and ready for instant service."</p>

<p>"Admiral Barkham also suggests, sir, that,
during the night, the officers in command of
your launches run without lights, when possible,
for secrecy," Whyte continued.</p>

<p>"How many launches will Admiral Barkham
put in service?" Admiral Timworth inquired.</p>

<p>"Three, sir," responded Whyte.</p>

<p>"Who will be the ranking officer in your fleet
of launches?"</p>

<p>"I believe I am to be, sir," Lieutenant Whyte
replied, bowing.</p>

<p>"Very good," nodded Admiral Timworth. "It
would not be courteous, in British waters, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Whyte, for me to appoint an officer who would
rank yourself, so I shall ask Captain Allen to
designate Ensign Darrin as ranking officer in
our launch fleet. Ensign Dalzell will naturally
command another of the launches. Who will
command the third, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Ensign Phillips," replied Captain Allen.</p>

<p>The courtesy of appointing an ensign to head
the American launch fleet lay in the fact that
an ensign is one grade lower in the service than
a junior lieutenant. When naval forces of different
nations act together the ranking officer,
no matter what country he represents, is in
command. Had Admiral Timworth put his
launch fleet in charge of a lieutenant commander,
for instance, then the British launches, too,
would have been under the command of the
American officer. As it was, Lieutenant Whyte
would be ranking and commanding officer in
the combined launch fleet. This was both right
and courteous, as Malta is an English possession,
and the waters near by are British waters.</p>

<p>Plans were briefly discussed, yet with the
thoroughness that is given to all naval operations.
Lieutenant Whyte departed, and Ensign Phillips
was sent for. Admiral Timworth and Captain
Allen charged the young officers with their
duties, upon the successful performance of which
so much depended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember, gentlemen," was Captain Allen's
final word, "that, in line with what the Admiral
has stated, you are merely to co-operate with,
and act under the orders of, the British ranking
officer. Yet, if occasion arise, you will display
all needed initiative in attaining the objective,
which is the capture of the scoundrelly plotters
and the seizure of the submarine before it can
work any mischief. You will even sink the
submarine by ramming, if no other course be
open to stop her wicked work."</p>

<p>Each of the flagship's launches was equipped
with a searchlight. While the council was going
on in the Admiral's quarters the electricians of
the ship were busy overhauling these searchlights
and making sure that all were in perfect working
order.</p>

<p>From the British flagship came a prearranged
signal to the effect that Lieutenant Whyte was
about to put off.</p>

<p>Dave's launch crew comprised, besides machinists
and the quartermaster, twenty-four sailors
and eight marines. A one-pound rapid-fire gun
was mounted in the bow, and a machine gun
amidships.</p>

<p>"Send your men over the side, Ensign Darrin,"
Captain Allen ordered, as he took Dave's hand.
"Go, and keep in mind, every second, how much
your work means to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," Dave answered.</p>

<p>When the word was passed, Dave's launch
party was marched out on deck and sent down
over the side. Dave Darrin took his place in
the stern, standing by to receive any further
instructions that might be shouted down to
him. "Cast off and clear!" called down the
executive officer.</p>

<p>Dan Dalzell, whose launch party was not to
clear until a later hour, waved a hand at his
chum. Dave waved back in general salute.</p>

<p>At the same time Lieutenant Whyte put off
from the "Albion" and sped onward to meet
the American craft.</p>

<p>"We are to sail in company to North Channel,"
called Whyte.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," Dave answered, saluting.</p>

<p>With three hundred feet of clear water between
them, the launches moved rapidly along.</p>

<p>The distance to the middle of North Channel
was about fifteen miles. Time and speed had
been so calculated that the yacht should not be
able to sight them by daylight. After dark the
two launches were to maneuver more closely
together, and Whyte, who knew the North
Channel, was to be pilot for both craft until it
came time to use their searchlights.</p>

<p>Over in the west the sun went down. Darkness
soon came on. Neither launch displayed even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
running lights. One had a sense of groping his
way, yet the launches dashed along at full speed.</p>

<p>Dave Darrin was now in the bow, with the
signalman at his side, who would turn on the
searchlight when so ordered. With his night
glasses at his eyes, Ensign Dave could tell when
the British launch veered sharply to port or
starboard, and thus was able to steer his own
course accordingly.</p>

<p>Twelve minutes later a brief ray shot from
the Englishman's searchlight. It was the signal.</p>

<p>"Turn on your light," Dave ordered to the
man at his side. "Swing it until you pick up
the North Channel. Then pick up and hold a
yacht&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ensign Darrin followed with the best description
he had of the strange yacht.</p>

<p>Less than a minute later the lights on both
navy launches had picked up the strange yacht,
well over in the Channel. Dave studied her
through his glass.</p>

<p>"That's the craft," Darrin muttered to himself.
"My, but she looks her part! While she
isn't large for a freighter, she's well calculated
for that class of work."</p>

<p>"Your best speed ahead, sir!" shouted Whyte,
through a megaphone. "Board the yacht on
her starboard quarter. Quick work, sir!"</p>

<p>"Very good, sir!" Dave called back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he stepped swiftly amidships to the
engineers.</p>

<p>"Get every inch of speed to be had out of the
engines, my man."</p>

<p>Next, to the helmsman:</p>

<p>"Quartermaster, steer straight ahead and make
that yacht's starboard quarter!"</p>

<p>As Dave turned, he found his own face within
three inches of Seaman Runkle's glowing countenance.</p>

<p>"Runkle," Dave smiled, "we are fond of the
Englishmen. Their commanding officer called
for our best speed, and we're going to show it."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" grinned Runkle. "When any
foreigner asks for the best we have in speed, he's
likely to see it, sir."</p>

<p>Already the "Hudson's" launch had drawn
smartly ahead of the British craft, and the distance
between them grew steadily, though the
Englishman was doing his best to keep up in
the race.</p>

<p>Under the yacht's stern dashed the launch,
and brought up smartly under the starboard
quarter, laying alongside.</p>

<p>"Hullo, there! Vat you call wrong?" demanded
a voice in broken English from the
yacht's rail.</p>

<p>"Naval party coming aboard, sir," Dave
responded courteously. "Take a line!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"I vill not!" came the defiant answer.</p>

<p>"All the same, then," Dave answered lightly.
"Bow, there! Make fast with grapple. Stern,
do the same!"</p>

<p>Two lines were thrown, each with a grappling
hook on the end. These caught on the yacht's
rail. Three or four sailormen, one after the
other, climbed the grappling lines. Two rope
ladders were swiftly rigged over the side, by the
Americans on the yacht's deck. Dave Darrin
was quickly on board, with twenty of his seamen
and all his marines, by the time that the English
launch rounded in alongside the port quarter.</p>

<p>"You? Vat you mean?" demanded a short,
swarthy-faced man, evidently captain of the
yacht, as he peered at Dave's party. "You are
American sailors!"</p>

<p>"Right," Darrin nodded.</p>

<p>"And dese are British vaters!"</p>

<p>"No matter," Dave smiled back at the blustering
fellow. "Here come the Englishmen."</p>

<p>For he had sent four of his men to catch and
make fast the lines from the British launch, and
now the British jack-tars, taking their beating
in the race good-humoredly, were piling on
board.</p>

<p>"Captain," cried Lieutenant Whyte, striding
forward, "I represent Admiral Barkham, ranking
officer of His Majesty's Navy in these waters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
I have the Admiral's orders to search this
craft."</p>

<p>"You search him for vat, sir?" demanded the
skipper.</p>

<p>"My orders are secret, sir. The search will
begin at once. Ensign Darrin, if you will leave
your marines to hold the deck, we will use all
our seamen and yours below."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," Dave replied, saluting. "You
do not wish any one allowed to leave the yacht,
do you, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Not without my permission or yours, Ensign."</p>

<p>Dave accordingly gave the order to the corporal
in charge of his marine party.</p>

<p>In another minute American and English tars
were swarming below decks on the yacht.</p>

<p>On deck and in the wheel house Darrin had not
seen more than four men of the yacht's crew,
besides the skipper.</p>

<p>"There do not seem to be any men below,"
Dave muttered, as he explored the yacht between
decks. "I wonder if that skipper gets along
with four deck hands in addition to his engine-room
and steward forces."</p>

<p>His men in squads, under petty officers, worked
rapidly. Dave Darrin moved more slowly, passing
on into the dining cabin and the social hall of
the yacht, which were below decks.</p>

<p>Adjoining the social hall were several cabins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Dave threw open the doors of the first few he
came to, finding in them no signs of occupation.</p>

<p>Then a steward, smiling and bowing, appeared
and asked him in French:</p>

<p>"Do you seek any one here?"</p>

<p>"You have a Prince aboard?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"Even so."</p>

<p>"And a Japanese nobleman?"</p>

<p>"We have."</p>

<p>"I wish to see them."</p>

<p>"Both are resting at present," the steward
expostulated.</p>

<p>"I must see them immediately," Dave insisted.</p>

<p>"It is hardly possible, sir," protested the
steward. "It is not to be expected that I can
disturb such august guests."</p>

<p>"Steward, do you wish me to summon my men
and have these cabin doors battered down?"</p>

<p>"Do not do that!" urged the steward in alarm.
"Wait! I have pass-keys. Which would you
see first?"</p>

<p>"The Prince, by all means."</p>

<p>"I will admit you to his room, Monsieur, and
next silently slip away. But be good enough to
let the Prince believe that he left his door unlocked.
This way, monsieur."</p>

<p>Finishing his whispered speech, the steward
glided ahead. He unlocked a cabin door, opening
it but a crack. Dave stepped softly inside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Instantly the door was pulled shut and
locked.</p>

<p>Through transoms on opposite sides of the cabin
Mender and Dalny showed their evil faces,
as each trained on the young naval officer an
ugly-looking naval revolver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>AFTER THE PEST OF THE SEAS</h3>


<p>"Make a sound, and you feed the fishes,
my fine young naval dandy!" hissed
Dalny.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" retorted Dave, contemptuously.
"Order your steward to unlock that door, or I
shall be put to the trouble of smashing it down
with my shoulder."</p>

<p>"And be shot in the back while you are doing
it," jeered Mender.</p>

<p>"I haven't had the honor of meeting you before,
but I take it that you are the bogus Russian
Prince," laughed Dave. "Just now, though,
you look much more like an apprentice to the
Black Hand."</p>

<p>"You should be saying your prayers, instead
of talking impudence," sneered Dalny.</p>

<p>"As for this cardboard Prince, words fail me,"
mocked Dave, still speaking in French, "but as
for you, Dalny, I have already tested your
courage, and know it to be worthless. You are
a coward, and would not dare to use that revolver,
knowing, as you must, that my men are aboard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and would tear you to pieces. Go ahead and
shoot, if you dare. I am going to break my way
out of this cabin, and then I shall arrest both of
you."</p>

<p>"Is there no way of compromising?" begged
Dalny, his evil face paling, "In exchange for
your life, Monsieur Darrin, can you not offer us
a chance for escape?"</p>

<p>"One brave man down!" laughed Ensign Dave.
"That was spoken like the coward that you are,
Dalny."</p>

<p>Darrin turned to break down the door. He
knew that he was taking chances, for the sham
Prince might be a man cast in a braver mould
than Dalny, and, in his desperation, might shoot
at the back that Dave so recklessly presented.</p>

<p>At the third lunge from Darrin's sturdy shoulder,
the door snapped open at the lock. The young
naval officer stepped out into the social hall.
There was no sign of the steward.</p>

<p>"Seaman here!" Dave bawled lustily. He was
obliged to repeat the summons twice before a
hearty "Aye, aye, sir!" was heard in the distance.</p>

<p>Then Jack Runkle showed his jovial face at
the top of the companionway. Catching sight of
his officer, Runkle bounded down the steps and
came up on a run, saluting.</p>

<p>"Runkle, go to the corporal of marines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and ask him to send two men here. Then stand
by."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>Runkle was off like a shot on his errand and
soon returned with two marines.</p>

<p>"Now, men," Dave directed, pointing to the
doors, "batter them down. That door, first."</p>

<p>As the men aligned themselves for the assault,
Darrin, mindful that the sham Prince was armed
and might prove ugly, stood by with his revolver
drawn.</p>

<p>Bang! crash! The door was down.</p>

<p>"It will be wise to surrender to superior force,"
Darrin called sternly. "We shall shoot to kill at
any sign of resistance."</p>

<p>As the words were uttered in French the marines
did not understand, but they advanced unhesitatingly
on Mender, disarmed him and led him
outside the room.</p>

<p>"Take care of him, Runkle," ordered Dave.
"Now, marines, that other door!"</p>

<p>Down came the barrier, and Dalny, shaking
and white, was brought out to keep Mender
company.</p>

<p>"Break down every door that's locked," was
Darrin's next order.</p>

<p>Within five minutes a little, quaking brown
man was secured and led out. All the locked
cabins had now been entered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're the Japanese marquis, are you?"
Dave jeered. "Do you find, Marquis, that it
pays any better than being a Filipino mess
attendant?"</p>

<p>The Filipino hung his head without answering.</p>

<p>"Take these prisoners to the corporal of marines,
and ask him to iron them and watch them closely,"
Dave directed. "Runkle, do you know where
Lieutenant Whyte is?"</p>

<p>"In the hold, sir, or was."</p>

<p>"Follow me, then, and we'll see if we can find
him."</p>

<p>Down in the main cargo hold forward, Dave
and Runkle came upon Whyte and a party of
English and American sailormen.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are, Mr. Darrin," called Whyte.
"We've been making a jolly big search through
the hold, but, except for ship's supplies, it appears
to contain nothing very interesting. However,
we shall have time to examine it further later
on. And you?"</p>

<p>"I have three prisoners," Dave explained, and
told who and what they were.</p>

<p>"Take them with you, Ensign, if you have
room on your launch," Whyte directed. "I
will now take my men above and post a guard,
so that you may withdraw your own guard
and get under way at once."</p>

<p>"We have done well so far," Dave answered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
as he gripped the English officer's hand. "I
pray that we may be permitted to do as well
all through the night."</p>

<p>Runkle was sent through the craft to recall all
of the American sailors.</p>

<p>When Dave reached the deck he found that
the entire crew of the yacht, including the engine-room
force and the stewards, had been rounded
up and driven to the deck.</p>

<p>"Over the side," directed Darrin, as his men,
recalled, gathered near him. He followed, but
went over last of all. Orders for casting off and
shoving clear were instantly given.</p>

<p>"Keep the engines up to their best performance
all the way," was Dave's order. "Boatswain's
mate, watch sharp for the courses, as I may
change frequently."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>Heading out of North Channel, Dave drove
back for Valetta, keeping about a mile off the
coast.</p>

<p>After making a few knots, he came abreast of
another British launch that lay further to seaward.
With lantern signals the Englishman
asked:</p>

<p>"Is the submarine supposed to be loose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dave had his signalman reply.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm here to warn incoming ships against
entering Grand Harbor to-night," the Englishman
wound up. "Are you seeking the submarine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dave had flashed back.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!" came heartily from the
English launch.</p>

<p>"Thank you," was Darrin's final response.</p>

<p>The searchlight of Dave's launch was swinging
busily from side to side, searching every bit of
the water's surface that could be reached.</p>

<p>"If the submarine comes up, Runkle, you may
be the first to sight her," Dave smiled to that
seaman, who stood beside him.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir; if I sight that craft I won't be
mean enough to keep my news to myself."</p>

<p>"I wonder where Dalzell is," thought Dave.
"What is he doing in this night's work?"</p>

<p>As for Ensign Dave, his every nerve was keyed
to its highest pitch. Outwardly he was wholly
calm, but he felt all the responsibility that rested
upon him to-night, as did every other officer who
commanded a launch from either fleet.</p>

<p>Searchlight and naked vision were not enough.
Almost constantly Darrin had his night glass at
his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the light shifted over the water,
Dave thought he caught sight of something
unusual.</p>

<p>"Steady with that light there, signalman," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
commanded suddenly. "Back slowly to port
with the beam."</p>

<p>Darrin forced himself to be calm.</p>

<p>"Steady," he called, again. "Hold the light
on anything you see, signalman."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir; I <i>do</i> see something," replied
the man who was manipulating the searchlight.</p>

<p>That he did see the mysterious something was
proved by the manner in which he kept the light
upon it.</p>

<p>That on which Darrin now trained his night
glass was a marked rippling on the water, half a
mile away, and farther seaward. A landsman
would have missed it altogether. Yet that rippling
on the sea's surface was clearly different
from the motion of the water near by.</p>

<p>"It might be a school of large fish," Dave
mused aloud, in Runkle's hearing, "though at
night they are likely to rest. Runkle, and you,
men, keep your eyes peeled to see if you can
make out fish leaping out of the water."</p>

<p>The ripple continued, unbroken at any point.
Moreover, it moved at uniform speed, and in a
line nearly parallel with the coast.</p>

<p>Gradually the launch gained on that ripple.
Dave could not turn his fascinated gaze away from
the sight.</p>

<p>"I think I know what that is, sir," broke in
Seaman Runkle, after three minutes of watching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure that I <i>do</i>, Runkle," Dave Darrin
returned. "It's a submarine, for some reason
just barely submerged. That line of ripple is
the wake left by her periscope."</p>

<p>As if to confirm the young naval officer's words,
the ripple parted. As the line on the water
broke, the periscope came fully into view, and
the turret showed above water, continuing to rise
until the deck was awash.</p>

<p>"There's the pest of the seas!" cried an excited
voice.</p>

<p>Every man on the launch was now straining
his eyes for a better look at the submarine,
barely a quarter of a mile away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE PUZZLE OF THE DEEP</h3>


<p>"Coxswain!" shouted Dave.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>"Send up three blue rockets!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>One after another the rockets ascended, bursting
high overhead and slowly falling.</p>

<p>From Grand Harbor, several miles distant, a
rocket ascended and burst, showing red.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Darrin's signal had been seen and answered.
Both fleets now knew that one of the launches
had sighted the submarine craft. The three blue
rockets had been the signal agreed upon in
advance. Runkle was at the gun. Ensign Darrin
gave him the range.</p>

<p>"I wish we had a four-inch gun in the bow,"
Dave muttered wistfully, "but we'll have to do
the best we can with the one-pounder. Ready!
Fire!"</p>

<p>Even before the command to fire had been
uttered the craft ahead had begun to submerge.</p>

<p>As the brisk, snappy report of the little piece
sounded, and a faint puff of smoke left her muzzle,
Runkle's head bobbed up to watch the result of
his shot.</p>

<p>"Forward of her turret by about a foot!"
Runkle muttered in disgusted criticism of his
own shooting.</p>

<p>A sailor had thrown the breech open, while a
second swabbed the bore through and the first
fitted in a fresh shell, closing the breech with a
snap.</p>

<p>Runkle seemed to sight and fire almost in the
same instant, and, as before, straightened up
to watch the accuracy of his shot by the splash
of water on the other side of the craft. The
launch's searchlight held a steady glare on the
mark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nearer by a few inches, sir," Runkle called
over his shoulder while the men with him swabbed
and loaded. Again Runkle fired.</p>

<p>"The shell must have passed aft of the turret
by about six inches," remarked Darrin, catching
through his glass a glimpse of the splash of
water where the little shell struck the waves.</p>

<p>"I'll do better, or drown myself, sir," growled
Runkle.</p>

<p>"Quick! She is submerging rapidly," commanded
Darrin.</p>

<p>Bang! An instant after the report a smothered
exclamation came from the unhappy gunner.
The submarine had safely submerged. Not
even her periscope was above water now.</p>

<p>"If the turret had been four inches nearer the
sky you'd have put it out of commission," declared
Ensign Darrin.</p>

<p>"Rotten work," growled Runkle in disgust.</p>

<p>"It's night shooting, my man," Dave answered.
"Good work just the same."</p>

<p>Runkle had an excellent gunnery record, and
Darrin did not like to see that fine fellow fretting
when he had done his best. None the less it
was highly important to send that submarine to
the bottom and quickly at that.</p>

<p>"We've got to go by bubbles, now," Darrin
declared. "She isn't likely to show her eye
again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Had he gotten the launch close enough to
observe the bubbles it is possible that the young
ensign could have followed the enemy trail.
Twice or thrice Dave believed that he had picked
up glimpses of bubbles with the searchlight, but
at last, with a sigh, he gave orders to shut off
speed and drift. Inaction became wellnigh
insupportable after a few moments and Darrin
called for slow speed ahead.</p>

<p>"There she is again" he cried. "There's her
periscope. The scoundrel is standing out to sea."</p>

<p>Over the starboard quarter the searchlight
signals of two other launches were observed.</p>

<p>"What's taking place?" came the signaled
question from one.</p>

<p>"Fired a few shots at a vanishing turret, but
missed," Dave ordered signaled back. "Enemy
standing out to sea. Am following."</p>

<p>"Will follow also," flashed back the answer.</p>

<p>"And one of their gunners will bag the game at
the first chance," groaned Runkle. "The jinx
is sitting tight on my chest to-night!"</p>

<p>"It might be, if there were any such animal as
a jinx," laughed Darrin. "Your missing was just
plain bad luck, Runkle. Your shooting was
good."</p>

<p>"The periscope is being pulled inboard, sir,"
called one of the seamen who stood by with
Runkle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see it. There she goes, under again," Dave
answered.</p>

<p>The Navy launch was dashing full speed ahead.
But with no clue to follow, Darrin passed some
anxious seconds. Should he follow on the course
he had been taking, or should he shut off speed?
In the dark there was a good chance that the
submarine commander, if so minded, would be
able to double and head back for shore.</p>

<p>Land lights were still visible from his position.
Dave turned to estimate their distance.</p>

<p>"About six knots off shore," he concluded,
half aloud.</p>

<p>"Sir?" questioned the corporal of marines,
thinking the ensign was addressing him.</p>

<p>"I was just telling myself that we're about six
knots off shore."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the corporal, saluting.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, you men who are near enough
to hear. Your understanding of what is in my
mind may help you the better to work with me
on this job. Two launches are keeping with us,
over the starboard, and I judge the nearer one
to be about four knots off. Coxswain, use the
lantern signal and ask who commands."</p>

<p>Soon Hardy discovered that, in order to make
his signal visible at that distance, he would have to
stand higher. Springing to the forward deck his
signal was instantly understood on the other craft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave, who had jumped up beside him, read the
answer:</p>

<p>"Ensign Dalzell."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it," Dave smiled. "Coxswain,
order number 2 launch to come up on parallel
course, standing off half-mile to starboard of
us."</p>

<p>"Order understood," was flashed back from
Dalzell's launch.</p>

<p>Bit by bit Dan overhauled, at last taking the
position indicated. Darrin's launch was moving
at slow speed now, for he did not care to run out
of sight of land, thus leaving the way clear for
the submarine to double on him and put back
toward Grand Harbor.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't the fellow take a chance on
torpedoing us?" was signaled from Dalzell's
launch.</p>

<p>"He has only three," was Darrin's reply.</p>

<p>That was brief, but Danny Grin understood,
as Dave had intended he should, that the submarine
was believed to be equipped with only
three torpedoes. Evidently the enemy still
hoped for a chance to sink a British battleship.</p>

<p>Suddenly he discovered that for which he
sought, and in the same instant a seaman called,
as the rays of the searchlight shifted:</p>

<p>"Periscope two points off the port bow, sir."</p>

<p>"Right!" clicked Ensign Darrin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I fire, sir?" begged Runkle, bending over
his piece.</p>

<p>"Yes, try it. Pretty long shot, though."</p>

<p>Before Runkle could aim and discharge his
piece a swift, red flash shot from the bow of the
number 2 launch commanded by Danny Grin.
Runkle fired a second later, but the periscope
still stood as if mocking the eager gunners.</p>

<p>"I'm glad somebody else missed," growled
Runkle, who was becoming exasperated. He
was doing himself injustice, though, for each
time he had fired, his mark, considering the
distance, had been small, and the searchlight
was no peer of daylight in aiding a gunner.</p>

<p>Ensign Darrin admitted to himself that he was
stumped. He ordered the course changed, with
speed ahead, his purpose being to scan the water
for the bubbled trail left by the underseas craft.
But by the time that he judged himself to be
going over the recently observed position of the
submersible the searchlight revealed no bubbles.</p>

<p>The third launch now coming in close, Dave,
by signal, ordered Ensign Sutton of the British
forces to go slowly inshore. He too was to
watch for bubbles, as well as to be alert for a
re-appearance of the enemy craft.</p>

<p>The longer the suspense lasted, the more uneasy
Darrin became.</p>

<p>"There she is, sir!" called a low but penetrating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
voice from the stern watch. "Three points off
the stern to port, sir."</p>

<p>So quickly did the helmsman bring the launch
about that she heeled and shipped a volume of
water. Darrin, as he leaped upon the forward
deck, ordered the sailor manning the searchlight
to shut off.</p>

<p>"Don't turn it on again without orders. I
believe I can follow the pest with my glass if she
will only keep her conning tower above water.
Signalman, send my order to the other launches
not to use their searchlights without first asking
permission."</p>

<p>By this time Darrin, standing on the forward
deck, had the submarine's turret, or as much of
it as showed, in the field of his night-glass.</p>

<p>Not more than a foot of it showed above water,
and, even through the glass, at a distance of
nearly half a mile, it would hardly have been
discernible without the aid of the searchlight,
had it not been for the white wake left by the
turret in its course through the water.</p>

<p>"May I try a shot now, sir?" begged Runkle,
"I'm certain I can hit the turret this time."</p>

<p>"If you could do it surely, you'd be the best
shot in the Navy," smiled Darrin. "I'm not
going to use the searchlight unless I have to, and
it would be almost impossible to make a hit
in the dark without it. The pest is headed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
shoreward, and I want to creep up close from the
rear, if possible."</p>

<p>Dissatisfied, Runkle none the less saluted and
turned back to his gun.</p>

<p>"Keep a close sight on the sneak," Dave called
after him. "When you hear me call 'Ready!'
you will complete your aim and fire without further
orders."</p>

<p>An order transmitted to the man standing by
the engine sent the launch plunging ahead at
increased speed.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the pursuit assumed a new aspect.
The submarine suddenly veered around to port,
and then headed straight toward the launch.</p>

<p>"Now's our chance!" glowed a seaman, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted another strained voice. "Our
chance for death!"</p>

<p>The same thought came into the minds of
many on the launch. The submarine, it seemed,
was about to discharge a torpedo at the pursuer.</p>

<p>"Starboard!" commanded Darrin. "Keep her
bow to port of us!"</p>

<p>Seaman Jack Runkle strained his ears for the
solitary word from Ensign Darrin that would be
so welcome.</p>

<p>"Will he ever give that order?" fumed the
impatient sailor at the breech of the one-pounder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>"Stand by, gunner!" warned Darrin.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" came from the man at
the one-pounder.</p>

<p>The crew had ceased to be on tension, for it
had dawned upon them that, as the two craft
were approaching each other almost head on,
there was hardly a chance that a torpedo could be
made to register.</p>

<p>"Ready!" Darrin ordered.</p>

<p>There was a sharp bark from the throat of the
one-pounder. Smash! A cheer went up from
the watching seamen. The shot hit the mark.
But the two men with Runkle were cleaning and
loading for still another shot at the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Any more, sir?" inquired Runkle, with a grin,
after firing and landing a second shot in the
submarine's superstructure.</p>

<p>"Not unless ordered," Darrin answered, crisply.
"If that fellow dives now he'll go below and stay
there for good."</p>

<p>Instead of diving, however, the top of the submarine's
conning tower was seen to rise higher
and higher above the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's rising, but she's lost her steerage way,
sir," announced the corporal of marines.</p>

<p>"The helmsman was undoubtedly killed by
the first or second shot," suggested Dave. "It
looks as if the survivors mean to surrender, but
we'll watch out for tricks."</p>

<p>He gave the order for slow speed ahead, soon
reducing it to mere headway.</p>

<p>"Marines prepare to board," ordered the ensign,
as the launch came up close to the now unmanageable
submarine, whose deck showed a bit
more than awash.</p>

<p>It called for fine work on the part of the quartermaster
to set his launch alongside without crushing
it.</p>

<p>Gauging closely with his eye, Ensign Darrin
called out:</p>

<p>"Ready to board! Board!"</p>

<p>Making the first leap himself, Dave landed on
both feet on the slippery deck of the undersea
boat, the marines following eagerly and quickly.</p>

<p>"Lay off and wait!" Dave called back to the
quartermaster. Then he stepped closer to the
conning tower, through which two holes had been
drilled by the two registering one-pound shells.</p>

<p>"Open up, you fellows down there!" Dave
called, briskly. "And don't attempt any tricks."</p>

<p>Inside he heard shuffling movements, but there
was no evidence of intent to obey his order. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he called again, but this time spoke in French,
believing that order might be more easily understood
by those inside the submarine.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot! I'll come up and open," answered
a voice in broken French, strongly tinged
with Maltese accent.</p>

<p>After a few moments the hatch was raised.
Then, one after another, eight or ten of Darrin's
crew went below.</p>

<p>"No more men below," ordered Dave, who then
followed his men in.</p>

<p>It was a miserable spectacle that met his eyes.
A heavy body lay face downward in a pool of
blood on the steel deck.</p>

<p>"Who was this?" demanded Dave of the other
four men who crouched to one side in fear and
trembling.</p>

<p>"Gortchky," answered one of the quartette
sullenly.</p>

<p>There could be little danger of mistaking the
dead man. Though no feature of the face had
been preserved, every line in that odious body
stood out clearly in Dave Darrin's mind. It was,
indeed, all that was left of Emil Gortchky. Mr.
Green Hat would never again steal the secrets of
nor plot trouble between nations!</p>

<p>"An able man, even if a wicked one," said
Dave slowly, uncovering in the presence of Death.</p>

<p>The body of Emil Gortchky was allowed to remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
where it lay. The other four men of the
submarine crew, one of whom was proved later
to be an expert submarine commander and a
deserter from the Swedish navy, were taken up
to the platform deck, and thence transferred to
the launch, where they were put beside Mender,
Dalny, the badly-scared Filipino, and the other
prisoners removed from the yacht.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dan Dalzell had ranged up
alongside, followed by Sutton of His Majesty's
Navy. Both of these young officers went aboard
the submarine and below deck for a look.</p>

<p>Rocket signals had informed those on anxious
watch in Grand Harbor of the capture of the submarine.
Congratulations had been signaled back.</p>

<p>Just as the dawn broke, watchers in the waters
near Valetta saw Dave Darrin's launch enter the
harbor, the submarine limping along in tow.</p>

<p>Early as the hour was, a band was lined up on
the quarter deck of the "Albion." When Darrin's
boat was within six cable-lengths, the band broke
out exultingly into the strains of "See the Conquering
Hero Comes!"</p>

<p>Probably no naval officer so young as Dave Darrin
had ever been so signally honored by a foreign
naval commander as was Dave Darrin then.</p>

<p>The submarine was anchored on a spot indicated
by the port authorities of Valetta. Then Dave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>Darrin shaped his course for the "Hudson."</p>

<p>From hundreds of men, lined up on the decks
of the flagship, rose lusty cheers.</p>

<p>"Bully boy, Darrin!" shouted a group of officers
from the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>"Ensign Darrin," cried Admiral Timworth,
striding forth from his quarters and grasping the
young ensign by the hand. "I offer you my
heartiest congratulations! For reward you shall
have anything within my power to grant."</p>

<p>"Sir, I know what I want most at present,"
Ensign Darrin replied, gravely.</p>

<p>"What?" asked the Admiral, quickly.</p>

<p>"A nap, a bath, clean clothing and a breakfast,
sir."</p>

<p>"But later on, Mr. Darrin?"</p>

<p>"At Port Said, sir, I shall ask Captain Allen
to grant me, if it does not interfere with duty,
three days ashore to meet my wife, whom I expect
to find there when the fleet arrives."</p>

<p>For, as readers of the Boys of the Army Series
are aware, Dave and his High School sweetheart,
Belle Meade, were wedded immediately at the
end of some border troubles in which Dave and
Dick Prescott were involved on the Mexican
border.</p>

<p>Despite, or perhaps on account of, the stirring
experiences through which he had passed, Darrin
was asleep five minutes after his head touched
the pillow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Danny Grin, who had been in only at the finish,
lay awake for an hour before slumber visited him.</p>

<p>All that was left of Emil Gortchky was dropped
into an unmarked, unhonored grave at Malta.
Mender, Dalny and the Filipino were condemned
by a British court-martial to be shot, a sentence
that was soon after carried out.</p>

<p>As for the master and crew of the yacht, they
persisted to the end in strenuously denying any
guilty knowledge of the real intentions of the
plotters. They escaped the death sentence, but,
as their conduct was none the less of a guilty
nature, the master of the yacht received a sentence
of twenty years in prison, while his subordinate
officers and the members of the crew were imprisoned
for ten years each.</p>

<p>On information supplied to the Italian government
Countess Ripoli was arrested. She was
not an Italian woman, but had married an Italian
nobleman who had died, after which she had
turned to spy work. She was locked up and held
for trial at Rome, but died of a fever before the
day of her trial arrived.</p>

<p>The minor spies and the thugs employed by
Gortchky and Dalny, unless they have since
fallen into trouble with their own local police,
have, of course, gone unpunished.</p>

<p>George Cushing, the secret service agent, is
now on duty in the Panama Canal Zone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>M. le Comte de Surigny was a happy man when
Dave visited him ashore on the day following the
capture of the submarine. Surigny is now in
Paris, the valued friend of a noted advocate, in
whose offices he is studying law. An inheritance
of comfortable proportions has since come to the
Count, but he has determined upon a career of
hard work. He is a strong, fine character in these
days, and is proving, to the full, the manhood
that Dave Darrin awakened in him.</p>

<p>The fleet remained a week at Port Said, Egypt.
Dave had three happy days ashore with Mrs.
Belle Darrin, and Danny Grin was often to be
found in their company.</p>

<p>Jack Runkle received his promised rating, becoming
a boatswain's mate. He is now industriously
climbing the ladder of promotion.</p>

<p>It is reluctantly, indeed, that we take leave of
Dave Darrin in this volume, but we shall meet
him and Danny Grin again, and very soon, in
the pages of the next volume of this series, which
will be published under the title, "<span class="smcap">Dave Darrin's
South American Cruise</span>; or, Two Innocent
Young Naval Tools of an Infamous Conspiracy."
In this absorbing story Dave Darrin and Dan
Dalzell are shown at their best as faithful and
loyal officers of Uncle Sam's Navy.</p>
